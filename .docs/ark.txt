## Setup Guide

<Steps>
<Step title="Prerequisite" number="1">

Before you start, ensure you have a proper project setup. If not, follow your preferred application framework setup
guide and then return to this guide.

</Step>
<Step title="Install Ark UI" number="2">

Install the Ark UI dependency using your preferred package manager.

```bash
npm install @ark-ui/react
// or
pnpm install @ark-ui/react
// or
yarn add @ark-ui/react
// or
bun add @ark-ui/react
```

</Step>
<Step number="3" title="Add a component">

In this guide, we will be adding a Slider component. Copy the following code to your project.

<ExampleCode component="slider" id="basic" />

</Step>

<Step number="4" title="Style a component">
Ark UI is a headless component library that doesn't include default styles.
You can leverage the `data-scope` and `data-part` attributes to style your components with custom CSS.

For example, to style a slider component, you can target its parts using these attributes:

```css
/* Targets the <Slider.Root /> */
[data-scope='slider'][data-part='root'] {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}
```

Check out the [Styling Components guide](/react/docs/guides/styling) to learn more about styling components in Ark UI.

</Step>

<Step number="5" title="That's it">

Congratulations! You've successfully set up and styled your components using Ark UI. If you run into any issues or have
questions, open an issue on our [GitHub](https://github.com/chakra-ui/ark/issues/new/choose) or reach out on
[Discord](https://discord.gg/ww6HE5xaZ2).

Happy hacking! ✌️

## [5.28.0] - 2025-11-14

### Added

- **General**: Exported `InteractOutsideEvent`, `FocusOutsideEvent`, and `PointerDownOutsideEvent` types for better type
  safety
- **Carousel**:
  - Added `Carousel.AutoplayIndicator` component for conditionally rendering content based on autoplay state
  - Added `Carousel.ProgressText` component for displaying current page progress (e.g., "1 / 5")
- **Toast**: Exported `ToastOptions` and `ToastStoreProps` types for better type safety

### Changed

- **useListCollection**: Updated `initialItems` to accept `readonly` arrays for better compatibility with immutable data
  patterns.

### Fixed

- **Combobox**:
  - Fixed focus stealing in controlled open mode
  - Removed problematic `aria-hidden` behavior to allow interaction with other page elements

## [5.27.1] - 2025-11-02

### Fixed

- **Dialog, Popover**: Improved shadow DOM support for interact outside and focus trap detection
- **Marquee**: Fixed Firefox flicker and added GPU acceleration
- **Dialog**: Fixed layout shift issue when using `scrollbar-gutter: stable` in CSS
- **Slider**: Fixed `onValueChangeEnd` callback not triggering for programmatic value changes

## [5.27.0] - 2025-11-01

### Added

- **Marquee** [New]: Initial release of marquee component for continuously scrolling content

### Fixed

- **Angle Slider**: Resolved an issue where dragging the thumb from non-center positions caused unexpected value jumps.
  The thumb now maintains consistent positioning relative to the initial click point.

- **Slider**: Fixed a problem where the thumb offset shifted dynamically during dragging, resulting in value jumps. The
  offset now remains constant from the pointer throughout the drag operation.

- **Date Picker**: Resolved a crash in the range date picker occurring when users typed the end date first by
  implementing `null`/`undefined` checks for date property access.

- **Radio Group**: Reverted to `offsetLeft`/`offsetTop` calculations to restore correct indicator positioning within
  scrollable container contexts.

- **Tabs**: Reverted to `offsetLeft`/`offsetTop` calculations to fix indicator positioning issues in scrollable
  containers.

  - Fixed wait step functionality
  - Added step validation on mount to verify configuration validity

## [5.26.2] - 2025-10-18

### Fixed

  supports `aria-label` and `aria-labelledby` props, and automatically falls back to the label element's ID for proper
  ARIA labeling.

- **Select**: Fix accessibility violation where the required state was not set correctly to on the trigger.

- **Tags Input**: Fix issue where entering a custom tag with combobox integration required pressing `Enter` twice. The
  tags-input now correctly handles custom values when the combobox has no highlighted item (`aria-activedescendant` is
  empty), allowing the tag to be added on the first `Enter` press.

## [5.26.1] - 2025-10-15

### Fixed

- **Checkbox**
  - Fix issue where setting initial checked state to `indeterminate` doesn't work
  - Ensure `api.checkedState` returns the correct checked state (`boolean | "indeterminate"`)

- **Collapsible**: Fix issue where `dir` prop value was hardcoded to `ltr` instead of using the provided value

- **Combobox**: Fix issue where controlled single-select combobox does not propagate its initial value to `inputValue`

- **Listbox**: Fix issue where pressing Enter key when no highlighted item still calls `event.preventDefault()`

- **Radio Group**: Refactor to use `getBoundingClientRect()` for precise indicator positioning

- **Slider**
  - Fix issue where slider could stop abruptly when scrubbing thumb
  - Fix issue where range slider thumbs become stuck when dragged to the same position without `minStepsBetweenThumbs`

- **Tabs**: Refactor to use `getBoundingClientRect()` for precise indicator positioning

- **Tags Input**: Fix issue where `maxLength` doesn't apply to the edit input as well

## [5.26.0] - 2025-10-08

### Added

- **Collapsible**: Add support for `collapsedHeight` and `collapsedWidth` props to control the dimensions of the
  collapsible content when in its collapsed state.

- **Focus Trap**: Allow elements referenced by `aria-controls` to be included in the trap scope. This makes it possible
  for menus, popovers, etc. to be portalled and work correctly.

- **Pagination**: Add `getPageUrl` prop for generating `href` attributes when using pagination as links.

```ts
const service = useMachine(pagination.machine, {
  type: 'link',
  getPageUrl: ({ page, pageSize }) => `/products?page=${page}&size=${pageSize}`,
})
```

- **Select**: Add `SelectRootComponentProps` type export for better component type composition.

- **Listbox**: Add `ListboxRootComponentProps` type export for better component type composition.

- **Combobox**: Add `ComboboxRootComponentProps` type export for better component type composition.

- **TreeView**:
  - Add `TreeViewRootComponentProps` type export for better component type composition.
  - (Experimental) Add support for node renaming functionality:
    - Add `TreeViewNodeRenameInput` component for inline node label editing
    - Add `canRename` prop to control which nodes can be renamed
    - Add `onRenameStart`, `onBeforeRename`, and `onRenameComplete` callbacks for rename lifecycle
    - Add `CheckedChangeDetails`, `LoadChildrenErrorDetails`, `RenameStartDetails`, and `RenameCompleteDetails` type
      exports

### Fixed

- **Scroll Area**: Fix RTL horizontal scrollbar positioning on Safari

- **Slider**: Fix issue where slider continues dragging when disabled during drag operation.

- **Switch**: Fix issue where `data-active` is inconsistently applied when `disabled` state changes at runtime

## [5.25.1] - 2025-09-27

### Fixed

- **Date Picker**
  - Fix issue where year range picker doesn't show the hovered range
  - Fix issue where quarter presets returns incorrect date

- **FormatByte**: Add support for `unitSystem` property to allow changing between decimal (1000 bytes) and binary (1024
  bytes) systems.

- **Number Input**: When `formatOptions` is used (like `style: "currency"`), the cursor would jump to the end of the
  input when typing in the middle. The cursor now maintains its relative position during formatting changes.

- **Pin Input**: Fix issue where using the keyboard shortcuts `Cmd+Backspace` and `Cmd+Delete` to delete text in pin
  inputs would insert "undefined" instead of clearing the field.

- **Scroll Area**: Fix issue where resize tracking was not observing the root element, which caused the scrollbar to not
  update when the root element's size changed.

## [5.25.0] - 2025-09-16

### Added

- Added `mergeProps` utility for combining multiple props objects with proper event handler and className merging.
- Added `createContext` utility for creating typed React contexts with improved DX.

```tsx
import { createContext } from '@ark-ui/react/utils'
```

### Fixed

- **AngleSlider**: Export `angleSliderAnatomy` from the anatomy exports

## [5.24.1] - 2025-09-14

### Fixed

- **General**: Fix issue where `mergeProps` throws when `props` is `undefined` or `null`

## [5.24.0] - 2025-09-14

### Added

- **Combobox**: Add `alwaysSubmitOnEnter` prop to allow bypassing the default two-step behavior (Enter to close
  combobox, then Enter to submit form) and instead submit the form immediately on Enter press. This is useful for
  single-field autocomplete forms where Enter should submit the form directly.

- **Dismissable**: Add support for layer types in dismissable layer stack. Layers can now be categorized as `dialog`,
  `popover`, `menu`, or `listbox`. This enables:
  - `data-nested` attribute on nested layers of the same type
  - `data-has-nested` attribute on parent layers with nested children of the same type
  - `--nested-layer-count` CSS variable indicating the number of nested layers of the same type

### Changed

- **Hover Card**: Change default delay values for hover card to improve accessibility.
  - `openDelay`: from `700ms` to `600ms`

- **Tooltip**: Change default delay values for tooltip to improve accessibility.
  [Learn more](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/timing-exposing-content)
  - `openDelay`: from `1000ms` to `400ms`
  - `closeDelay`: from `500ms` to `150ms`

### Removed

- **TimePicker**: The TimePicker component has been removed from this release. This component was never part of the
  public API and was considered experimental. It had significant bugs and usability issues across all frameworks and
  locales, making it unsuitable for production use.

  **Migration**: We recommend building a custom time picker using the Select component for simple use cases, or
  implementing a time grid pattern for more complex scenarios.

### Fixed

- **Editable**: Allow text selection in editable preview when `autoResize` is enabled

  Previously, when `autoResize` was set to `true`, the preview element had `userSelect: "none"` applied, preventing
  users from selecting text. This has been fixed by removing the `userSelect` style property.

- **File Upload**: Fix regression where clicking the trigger doesn't open the file picker when used within the dropzone

- **Menu**:
  - Fix issue where keyboard activation of menu items with `target="_blank"` would open two tabs
  - Fix issue where hovering a partially visible item with pointer causes it to scroll into view

- **Tabs**: Fix issue where `ids` for `item` and `content` could not be customized

- **Toast**: Allow creating a toast store without any arguments

## [5.23.0] - 2025-09-08

### Added

- **Field**: Add `data-required` attribute to `Field.Label`
- **Select, Combobox, Listbox, TreeView**: Export `RootComponent` and `RootProviderComponent` types which are useful
  when building compositions that wrap the `Root` and `RootProvider` components and you still want type-safety for the
  collection.

### Fixed

- **Menu**: Fix `Menu.ItemText` not working inside `Menu.TriggerItem`

  ```tsx
  import { Select } from '@ark-ui/react/select'
  import { styled } from 'styling-lib'

  const Root = styled(Select.Root) as Select.RootComponent<{}>
  ```

## [5.22.0] - 2025-08-28

### Added

- **Combobox**: Add `ComboboxEmpty` component to display content when the combobox has no items

- **Listbox**: Add `ListboxEmpty` component to display content when the listbox has no items

- **Hover Card**: Add support for `disabled` prop

### Fixed

- **Collection**: Fix issue where disabled items could be reached via typeahead

- **Color Picker**: Fix issue where color picker was not working correctly in RTL mode

- **Date Picker**: Fix issue where datepicker doesn't revert to a valid value when the input value exceeds the min/max
  and blurred

- **Dismissable**: Expose `onRequestDismiss` custom event handler for event a parent layer requests the child layer to
  dismiss. If prevented via `event.preventDefault()`, the child layer will not dismiss when the parent layer is
  dismissed.

- **Number Input**
  - Omit the input `pattern` when `formatOptions` is provided. This prevents native pattern validation from conflicting
    with formatted values (e.g., currency or percent).
  - Handle empty values consistently across all format options.
  - Add `data-scrubbing` attribute to the number input parts.

- **Tags Input**: Fix issue where highlighted item doesn't clear when tabbing out of the input to an external button
  within the `control` part.

- **Tooltip**
  - Set `closeOnPointerdown` to `false` when `closeOnClick` is set to `false`
  - Reduce bundle size by replacing `@zag-js/store` dependency with a lightweight store implementation.

## [5.21.0] - 2025-08-24

### Added

- **Hooks**: Add `useAsyncList` and `useCollator` hooks for managing asynchronous list operations and locale-aware
  string comparison
- **Toast**: Export type definitions `ToastActionOptions`, `ToastPlacement`, `ToastPromiseOptions`, `ToastStatus`,
  `ToastStatusChangeDetails`, and `ToastType`

### Changed

- **Fieldset**
  - Update Legend component to render as `div` instead of `legend` element for improved styling flexibility
  - Add `aria-labelledby` attribute to fieldset root for better accessibility by linking to legend

### Fixed

- **Date Picker**
  - Clear hovered range state after completing range selection instead of waiting for pointer to leave the calendar
    area.
  - Fix issue where month and year select labels don't update correctly when using `min`/`max` constraints.
  - Expose `disabled` on `api.getMonths()` and `api.getYears()` results to indicate options out of range for current
    constraints.

- **Listbox**
  - Fix issue where first enabled item should be highlighted by default when listbox receives focus and no item is
    currently highlighted.
  - Add `getElement` to `scrollToIndexFn` details
  - Track collection changes and clear `highlightedValue` if the item is no longer in the collection.

- **Scroll Area**
  - Avoid detecting hover state from portalled descendants.
  - Add `data-dragging` attribute to scroll area parts.

- **Select**: Add `getElement` to `scrollToIndexFn` details

- **Listbox**: Add support for navigating grid collections

- **Carousel**:
  - Fix an issue where the carousel would not update when `slideCount` or `autoplay` props change.
  - Fix an issue where `loop: false` was ignored when using autoplay. Now, the carousel will stop when it gets to the
    last slide.

- **Date Picker**: Expose `data-inline` attribute on Content part to enable distinct styling for inline date pickers
  versus popover date pickers.

- **Menu**: Fix issue where `onCheckedChange` could be called twice on checkbox or radio item

- **Tree View**: Fixed issue where tree view doesn't scroll into view when content overflows.

## [5.18.0] - 2025-07-22

### Added

- **Collection**: Add `useListSelection` hook for managing collection item selection with support for single/multiple
  selection modes

  ```jsx
  const collection = createListCollection({ items: ['React', 'Vue', 'Angular'] })
  const selection = useListSelection({ collection })

  // Check if item is selected
  const isSelected = selection.isSelected('React')

  // Select/deselect items
  selection.select('React')
  selection.toggle('Vue')
  ```

  `defaultAcceptedFiles`

- **Signature Pad**: Add support for programmatically controlling the paths via `paths` and `defaultPaths` props.

- **Date Picker**: Added hover range preview support for date picker range selection. Added `inHoveredRange`,
  `firstInHoveredRange`, and `lastInHoveredRange` properties to `DayTableCellState` with corresponding data attributes
  `data-in-hover-range`, `data-hover-range-start`, and `data-hover-range-end`.

  Hover range states are only active when not overlapping with actual selected range, enabling distinct styling for
  hover preview vs actual selection in range mode.

### Fixed

- **Date Picker**: Fix date comparison issues when time components are involved. This resolves critical issues with date
  comparison operations when different date types (`CalendarDate`, `CalendarDateTime`, `ZonedDateTime`) are mixed,

- **File Upload**
  - Export `FileError`, `FileMimeType`, and `FileRejection` types
  - Fix issue where calling `api.setFiles` invokes validation with incorrect `acceptedFiles`
  - Fix issue where the browser might not be able to infer the mime type of a file due to limitations, drag source or
    security restrictions. As a fallback in the file validation logic, we now infer the mime type from the file
    extension.

### Fixed

- **Combobox**
  - Expose `reason` to `onOpenChange` and `onInputValueChange` callbacks

### Fixed

- **General**: Ensure pointerdown or click event handlers only execute when the main button is clicked
- **Tree View**: Exported `TreeViewNodeState` and `TreeViewNodeProps` types from `@zag-js/tree-view`

### Changed

- **Collection**: Improve the APIs around `tree.flatten(...)` and `flattenedToTree` to ensure the original node
  properties are preserved.

  > Previously, `tree.flatten()` would return an array of objects with `value` and `label` stripping out the original
  > node properties.

  ```ts
  const tree = new TreeCollection({
    rootNode: {
      value: 'ROOT',
      children: [{ value: 'child1' }, { value: 'child2' }],
    },
  })

  const flattened = tree.flatten()
  const reconstructed = flattenedToTree(flattened)

  console.log(reconstructed.rootNode)

  // {
  //   value: "ROOT",
  //   children: [{ value: "child1" }, { value: "child2" }],

- **Smaller bundle size** – Leaner components and adapters for a more efficient build.

We made this happen by using React’s native reactive primitives instead of external stores.

In our stress tests with **10,000 components**, Ark v5 delivered **1.5x–4x** better performance across the board.

![Performance comparison showing Ark v5 is 1.5x-4x faster than other libraries](./v5.svg)

### A quick note on tests

Most component updates are non-breaking, but due to this change, some tests may need adjustments. For example:

```jsx
// Before
it('should open by default', () => {
  render(<ComponentUnderTest defaultOpen />)
  expect(screen.getByRole('dialog')).toBeInTheDocument()
})

// After
it('should open by default', async () => {
  render(<ComponentUnderTest defaultOpen />)
  expect(await screen.findByRole('dialog')).toBeInTheDocument()
})
```

# About Ark UI

## Motivation

Most popular UI component libraries are designed to work with a specific JavaScript framework. Building UI components
that work across different JavaScript frameworks presents significant challenges for organizations working with diverse
technology stacks.

## Solution

Ark UI provides components for building complex, interactive, and accessible user interfaces across multiple JavaScript
frameworks. To achieve this, Ark UI is built on top of [Zag.js](https://zagjs.com), a UI component library powered by
Finite State Machines. Check out the architecture diagram below for a high-level overview.

# Styling

## Overview

Ark UI is a headless component library that works with any styling solution. It provides functional styles for elements
like popovers for positioning, while leaving presentation styles up to you. Some components also expose CSS variables
that can be used for styling or animations.

> **Tip:** Looking for a ready-to-use solution? Checkout [Park UI](https://park-ui.com) for a collection of pre-designed
> styles based on Ark UI components.

### Data Attributes

Ark UI components use `data-scope` and `data-part` attributes to target specific elements within a component.
Interactive components often include `data-*` attributes to indicate their state. For example, here's what an open
accordion item looks like:

```html
<div data-scope="accordion" data-part="item" data-state="open"></div>
```

For more details on each component's data attributes, refer to their respective documentation.

## Styling with CSS

When styling components with CSS, you can target the data attributes assigned to each component part for easy
customization.

### Styling a Part

To style a specific component part, target its `data-scope` and `data-part` attributes:

```css
[data-scope='accordion'][data-part='item'] {
  border-bottom: 1px solid #e5e5e5;
}
```

### Styling a State

To style a component based on its state, use the `data-state` attribute:

```css
[data-scope='accordion'][data-part='item'][data-state='open'] {
  background-color: #f5f5f5;
}
```

> **Tip:** If you prefer using classes instead of data attributes, utilize the `class` or `className` prop to add custom
> classes to Ark UI components.

### Class Names

If you prefer using classes instead of data attributes, utilize `class` or `className` prop to add custom classes to Ark
UI components.

Pass a class:

```jsx
<Accordion.Root>
  <Accordion.Item className="AccordionItem">{/* … */}</Accordion.Item>
</Accordion.Root>
```

Then use in styles:

```css
.AccordionItem {
  border-bottom: 1px solid #e5e5e5;

  &[data-state='open'] {
    background-color: #f5f5f5;
  }
}
```

## Styling with Panda CSS

[Panda CSS](https://panda-css.com) is a best-in-class CSS-in-JS framework that integrates seamlessly with Ark UI,
providing an efficient styling solution.

### Styling a part

Panda offers various ways to write styles, but in the context of Ark UI, we recommend using the `defineSlotRecipe`
function to style a component with its different parts and variants.

> **Important:** When importing anatomy objects, we recommend using the `@ark-ui/<framework>/anatomy` entrypoint (e.g.,
> `@ark-ui/react/anatomy`) instead of the main package export to avoid potential build and import errors.

```ts
import { accordionAnatomy } from '@ark-ui/react/anatomy'
import { defineSlotRecipe } from '@pandacss/dev'

export const accordionStyles = defineSlotRecipe({
  className: 'accordion',
  slots: accordionAnatomy.keys(),
  base: {
    item: {
      borderBottom: '1px solid #e5e5e5',
    },
  },
  defaultVariants: {},
  variants: {},
})
```

### Styling a state

To style a component based on its state, you can use built in
[conditions](https://panda-css.com/docs/customization/conditions) in Panda CSS.

```ts
import { accordionAnatomy } from '@ark-ui/react/anatomy'
import { defineSlotRecipe } from '@pandacss/dev'

export const accordionStyles = defineSlotRecipe({
  className: 'accordion',
  slots: accordionAnatomy.keys(),
  base: {
    item: {
      borderBottom: '1px solid {colors.gray.300}',
      _open: {
        // [!code highlight]
        backgroundColor: 'gray.100',
      },
    },
  },
  defaultVariants: {},
  variants: {},
})
```

## Styling with Tailwind CSS

[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) is a utility-first CSS framework providing a flexible way to style your
components.

### Styling a Part

To style a part, apply classes directly to the parts using either `class` or `className`, depending on the JavaScript
framework.

```jsx
<Accordion.Root>
  <Accordion.Item className="border-b border-gray-300">{/* … */}</Accordion.Item>
</Accordion.Root>
```

### Styling a State

Leverage Tailwind CSS's variant selector to style a component based on its data-state attribute.

```jsx
<Accordion.Root>
  <Accordion.Item className="border-b border-gray-300 data-[state=open]:bg-gray-100">{/* … */}</Accordion.Item>
</Accordion.Root>
```


# Composition

## The asChild Prop

In Ark UI, the `asChild` prop lets you integrate custom components, ensuring consistent styling and behavior while
promoting flexibility and reusability. All Ark components that render a DOM element accept the `asChild` prop.

Here's an example using `asChild` to integrate a custom `Button` component within a `Popover`:

<ExampleCode id="as-child" component="popover" />

In this example, the `asChild` prop allows the `Button` to be used as the trigger for the `Popover`, inheriting its
behaviors from Popover.Trigger.

## The Ark Factory

You can use the `ark` factory to create your own elements that work just like Ark UI components.

<ExampleCode id="factory" component="popover" />

This will produce the following HTML:

```html
<span id="child" class="parent child" style="background: red; color: blue;">Ark UI</span>
```

## ID Composition

When composing components that need to work together, share IDs between them using the `ids` prop for proper
accessibility and interaction.

```tsx
import { Avatar } from '@ark-ui/react/avatar'
import { Tooltip } from '@ark-ui/react/tooltip'
import { useId } from 'react'

export const TooltipWithAvatar = () => {
  const id = useId()

  return (
    <Tooltip.Root ids={{ trigger: id }}>
      <Tooltip.Trigger asChild>
        <Avatar.Root ids={{ root: id }}>
          <Avatar.Image src="https://bit.ly/sage-adebayo" />
          <Avatar.Fallback>SA</Avatar.Fallback>
        </Avatar.Root>
      </Tooltip.Trigger>
      <Tooltip.Positioner>
        <Tooltip.Content>Segun Adebayo is online</Tooltip.Content>
      </Tooltip.Positioner>
    </Tooltip.Root>
  )
}
```

Both components share the same `id` through their `ids` props, creating proper accessibility bindings, `aria-*`
attributes and interaction behavior.

## Limitations

When using the `asChild` prop, ensure you pass only a single child element. Passing multiple children may cause
rendering issues.

Certain components, such as `Checkbox.Root` or `RadioGroup.Item`, have specific requirements for their child elements.
For instance, they may require a label element as a child. If you change the underlying element type, ensure it remains
accessible and functional.


# Component State

## Context Components

Context components expose state and functions to child components. In this example, `Avatar.Fallback` renders based on
`loaded` state.

> **Good to know (RSC)**: Due to the usage of render prop, you might need to add the `'use client'` directive at the top
> of your file when using React Server Components.

<ExampleCode id="context" component="avatar" />

## Provider Components

Provider components can help coordinate state and behavior between multiple components, enabling interactions that
aren't possible with `Context` components alone. They are used alongside component hooks.

> When using the `RootProvider` component, you don't need to use the `Root` component.

<ExampleCode id="root-provider" component="accordion" />


# Animation

Adding animation to Ark UI Components is as straightforward as with any other component, but keep in mind some
considerations when working with exit animations with JavaScript animation libraries.

## Animating with CSS

The most straightforward method to animate your elements is using CSS. You can animate both the mounting and unmounting
phases with CSS. The latter is achievable because Ark UI Components postpones the unmounting while your animation runs.

Below is a simple example of creating a fade-in and fade-out animation using CSS keyframes:

```css
@keyframes fadeIn {
  from {
    opacity: 0;
  }
  to {
    opacity: 1;
  }
}

@keyframes fadeOut {
  from {
    opacity: 1;
  }
  to {
    opacity: 0;
  }
}
```

You can use these keyframes to animate any element during its lifecycle. For instance, to apply the `fadeIn` animation
when your `Tooltip` enters the 'open' state, and `fadeOut` when it enters the 'closed' state, you could use the
following styles:

```css
[data-scope='tooltip'][data-part='content'][data-state='open'] {
  animation: fadeIn 300ms ease-out;
}

[data-scope='tooltip'][data-part='content'][data-state='closed'] {
  animation: fadeOut 300ms ease-in;
}
```

## Animating with JS Libraries

There's plenty of versatility when it comes to animating your Ark UI Elements with JavaScript libraries. Various
libraries such as GreenSock, anime.js, Framer Motion, and more can add a new level of interaction and feedback to your
UI components.

One significant advantage of using Ark UI Elements is the control you have over the unmounting phase of your components.
This is primarily facilitated through the `present` prop. The `present` prop allows the component to stay mounted even
after its enclosing condition has been falsified, allowing for exit animations to complete before the component is
removed from the DOM.


# Forms

Ark UI provides the `Field` and `Fieldset` components for integrating with native `form` element or popular form
libraries like [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/), [TanStack Form](https://tanstack.com/form/latest), and
[Vee Validate](https://vee-validate.logaretm.com).

## Field Context

Form components in Ark UI automatically integrate with `Field` through context. When nested inside a `Field.Root`, they
inherit `disabled`, `invalid`, `required`, and `readOnly` states automatically.

```tsx
import { Field } from '@ark-ui/react/field'
import { NumberInput } from '@ark-ui/react/number-input'

const Demo = () => (
  <Field.Root disabled>
    <NumberInput.Root /> {/* NumberInput will be disabled */}
  </Field.Root>
)
```

### Accessible Labels

When building accessible forms, you need to ensure that they are properly labeled and described.

- `Field.Label`: Used to provide an accessible label the input.
- `Field.HelperText`: Used to provide additional instructions about the input.

These components are automatically linked to the input element via the `aria-describedby` attribute.

> **Best practice**: Make sure that labels are visible (and not just used as placeholders) for screen readers to read
> them.

```tsx
import { Field } from '@ark-ui/react/field'

const Demo = () => (
  <form>
    <Field.Root>
      <Field.Label>Username</Field.Label>
      <Field.Input placeholder="Enter your username" />
      <Field.HelperText>This will be your public display name.</Field.HelperText>
    </Field.Root>
  </form>
)
```

### Error Handling and Validation

When the input is invalid, you can use the `Field.ErrorText` component to provide an error message for the input, and
pass the `invalid` prop to the `Field.Root` component.

> **Best practice**: Make sure to provide clear, specific error messages that are easy to understand and fix.

```tsx
import { Field } from '@ark-ui/react/field'

const Demo = () => (
  <form>
    <Field.Root invalid>
      <Field.Label>Username</Field.Label>
      <Field.Input placeholder="Enter your username" />
      <Field.ErrorText>Username is required.</Field.ErrorText>
    </Field.Root>
  </form>
)
```

### Required Fields

To indicate that a field is required, you can pass the `required` prop to the `Field.Root` component. Optionally, you
can use the `Field.RequiredIndicator` component to indicate that the field is required.

> **Best practice**: Don't rely solely on color to indicate required status

```tsx
import { Field } from '@ark-ui/react/field'

export const Demo = () => (
  <form>
    <Field.Root required>
      <Field.Label>
        Username
        <Field.RequiredIndicator>(required)</Field.RequiredIndicator>
      </Field.Label>
      <Field.Input placeholder="Enter your username" />
      <Field.ErrorText>Username is required.</Field.ErrorText>
    </Field.Root>
  </form>
)
```

To indicate that a field is optional, use the `fallback` prop on the `Field.RequiredIndicator` component.

```tsx
<Field.RequiredIndicator fallback="Optional">(required)</Field.RequiredIndicator>
```

### Native Controls

Field supports native HTML form controls including `input`, `textarea`, and `select`:

```tsx
import { Field } from '@ark-ui/react/field'

const Demo = () => (
  <form>
    {/* Input */}
    <Field.Root>
      <Field.Label>Email</Field.Label>
      <Field.Input type="email" placeholder="you@example.com" />
    </Field.Root>

    {/* Textarea */}
    <Field.Root>
      <Field.Label>Bio</Field.Label>
      <Field.Textarea placeholder="Tell us about yourself" />
    </Field.Root>

    {/* Select */}
    <Field.Root>
      <Field.Label>Country</Field.Label>
      <Field.Select>
        <option value="us">United States</option>
        <option value="uk">United Kingdom</option>
        <option value="de">Germany</option>
      </Field.Select>
    </Field.Root>
  </form>
)
```

### Form Reset

When the `reset` event is triggered on a form, all Ark UI components automatically sync their internal state with the
form's reset values.

> **Note**: For this to work correctly, always include the `HiddenInput` component in your form controls. The hidden
> input participates in the native form reset mechanism, and Ark UI listens for this to sync the component state.

```tsx
import { Checkbox } from '@ark-ui/react/checkbox'

const Demo = () => {
  return (
    <form>
      <Checkbox.Root name="terms" defaultChecked>
        <Checkbox.Label>I agree to the terms</Checkbox.Label>
        <Checkbox.Control>
          <Checkbox.Indicator />
        </Checkbox.Control>
        <Checkbox.HiddenInput />
      </Checkbox.Root>

      {/* Clicking reset will restore checkbox to defaultChecked state */}
      <button type="reset">Reset</button>
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  )
}
```

## Fieldset Context

When you have multiple fields in a form or a component that renders multiple `input` elements, you can use the
`Fieldset` component to group them together.

Common use cases checkbox group, radio group, input + select composition, etc.

### Checkbox Group

```tsx
import { Fieldset } from '@ark-ui/react/fieldset'
import { Checkbox } from '@ark-ui/react/checkbox'
import { CheckIcon } from 'lucide-react'

const items = [
  { label: 'React', value: 'react' },
  { label: 'Solid', value: 'solid' },
  { label: 'Vue', value: 'vue' },
  { label: 'Svelte', value: 'svelte' },
]

const Demo = () => (
  <Fieldset.Root>
    <Fieldset.Legend>Frameworks</Fieldset.Legend>
    <Checkbox.Group name="framework">
      {items.map((item) => (
        <Checkbox.Root value={item.value} key={item.value} />
      ))}
    </Checkbox.Group>
    <Fieldset.HelperText>Choose your preferred frameworks</Fieldset.HelperText>
  </Fieldset.Root>
)
```

### Radio Group

```tsx
import { Fieldset } from '@ark-ui/react/fieldset'
import { RadioGroup } from '@ark-ui/react/radio-group'
import { RadioIcon } from 'lucide-react'

const items = [
  { label: 'React', value: 'react' },
  { label: 'Solid', value: 'solid' },
  { label: 'Vue', value: 'vue' },
  { label: 'Svelte', value: 'svelte' },
]

const Demo = () => (
  <Fieldset.Root>
    <Fieldset.Legend>Frameworks</Fieldset.Legend>
    <RadioGroup.Root name="framework">
      {items.map((item) => (
        <RadioGroup.Item value={item.value} key={item.value} />
      ))}
    </RadioGroup.Root>
    <Fieldset.HelperText>Choose your preferred framework</Fieldset.HelperText>
  </Fieldset.Root>
)
```

## React Hook Form

Ark UI integrates seamlessly with React Hook Form. Use the `register` function for simple inputs and `Controller` for
complex components.

### Native Controls

```tsx
import { Field } from '@ark-ui/react/field'
import { useForm } from 'react-hook-form'

interface FormValues {
  firstName: string
  email: string
}

const Demo = () => {
  const {
    register,
    handleSubmit,
    formState: { errors },
  } = useForm<FormValues>()

  const onSubmit = (data: FormValues) => console.log(data)

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit(onSubmit)}>
      <Field.Root invalid={!!errors.firstName}>
        <Field.Label>First Name</Field.Label>
        <Field.Input {...register('firstName', { required: 'First name is required' })} />
        <Field.ErrorText>{errors.firstName?.message}</Field.ErrorText>
      </Field.Root>

      <Field.Root invalid={!!errors.email}>
        <Field.Label>Email</Field.Label>
        <Field.Input
          {...register('email', {
            required: 'Email is required',
            pattern: { value: /^\S+@\S+$/i, message: 'Invalid email address' },
          })}
        />
        <Field.ErrorText>{errors.email?.message}</Field.ErrorText>
      </Field.Root>

      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  )
}
```

### Custom Components

Use the `Controller` hook to integrate custom form components like select or combobox.

> **Best practice**: To ensure `react-hook-form` moves focus to invalid field control when performing validation,
> forward the field's `ref` to the respective Ark UI component.

```tsx
import { Field } from '@ark-ui/react/field'
import { Select, createListCollection } from '@ark-ui/react/select'
import { Controller, useForm } from 'react-hook-form'

const Demo = () => {
  const { control, handleSubmit } = useForm({
    defaultValues: { framework: '' },
  })

  const collection = createListCollection({
    items: ['React', 'Solid', 'Vue', 'Svelte'],
  })

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit((data) => console.log(data))}>
      <Controller
        name="framework"
        control={control}
        rules={{ required: 'Please select a framework' }}
        render={({
          field: { name, ref, value, onBlur, onChange },
          fieldState: { invalid, isTouched, isDirty, error },
        }) => (
          <Field.Root invalid={invalid}>
            <Select.Root
              name={name}
              collection={collection}
              value={value ? [value] : []}
              onValueChange={(e) => onChange(e.value[0])}
              onInteractOutside={() => onBlur()}
            >
              <Select.Label>Framework</Select.Label>
              <Select.Control>
                <Select.Trigger ref={ref}>
                  <Select.ValueText placeholder="Select a Framework" />
                </Select.Trigger>
              </Select.Control>
              <Select.Positioner>
                <Select.Content>
                  {collection.items.map((item) => (
                    <Select.Item key={item} item={item}>
                      <Select.ItemText>{item}</Select.ItemText>
                    </Select.Item>
                  ))}
                </Select.Content>
              </Select.Positioner>
              <Select.HiddenSelect />
            </Select.Root>
            <Field.ErrorText>{error?.message}</Field.ErrorText>
          </Field.Root>
        )}
      />
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  )
}
```

## TanStack Form

TanStack Form provides powerful form state management that works well with Ark UI.

### Native Controls

```tsx
import { useForm } from '@tanstack/react-form'

const form = useForm({
  defaultValues: { firstName: '' },
})

const Demo = () => (
  <form onSubmit={form.handleSubmit}>
    <form.Field
      name="firstName"
      children={(field) => (
        <Field.Root
          name={field.name}
          invalid={!field.state.meta.isValid}
          dirty={field.state.meta.isDirty}
          touched={field.state.meta.isTouched}
        >
          <Field.Label>First Name</Field.Label>
          <Field.Input
            value={field.state.value}
            onChange={(e) => field.handleChange(e.target.value)}
            onBlur={field.handleBlur}
          />
          <Field.ErrorText match={!field.state.meta.isValid}>{field.state.meta.errors.join(',')}</Field.ErrorText>
        </Field.Root>
      )}
    />
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
  </form>
)
```

### Custom Components

Here's an example of how to integrate custom components like the select or combobox with Tanstack's `form.Field`
component.

```tsx
import { Field } from '@ark-ui/react/field'
import { Select, createListCollection } from '@ark-ui/react/select'
import { useForm } from '@tanstack/react-form'

const Demo = () => {
  const form = useForm({
    defaultValues: { username: '' },
  })

  const collection = createListCollection({
    items: ['React', 'Solid', 'Vue', 'Svelte'],
  })

  return (
    <form
      onSubmit={(e) => {
        e.preventDefault()
        e.stopPropagation()
        form.handleSubmit()
      }}
    >
      <form.Field
        name="username"
        validators={{
          onChange: ({ value }) => (value.length < 3 ? 'Username must be at least 3 characters' : undefined),
        }}
        children={(field) => (
          <Field.Root invalid={field.state.meta.errors.length > 0}>
            <Field.Label>Username</Field.Label>
            <Select.Root
              name={field.name}
              collection={collection}
              value={field.state.value ? [field.state.value] : []}
              onValueChange={(e) => field.handleChange(e.value[0])}
              onInteractOutside={() => field.handleBlur()}
            >
              <Select.Label>Username</Select.Label>
              <Select.Control>
                <Select.Trigger>
                  <Select.ValueText placeholder="Enter your username" />
                </Select.Trigger>
              </Select.Control>
              <Select.Positioner>
                <Select.Content>
                  {collection.items.map((item) => (
                    <Select.Item key={item} item={item}>
                      <Select.ItemText>{item}</Select.ItemText>
                    </Select.Item>
                  ))}
                </Select.Content>
              </Select.Positioner>
              <Select.HiddenSelect />
            </Select.Root>
          </Field.Root>
        )}
      />
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  )
}
```


# Refs

## React

In React, the `ref` prop can be used to access the rendered element. Use the `useRef` hook to create a reference and
pass it to the component.

```tsx
import { Slider } from '@ark-ui/react/slider'
import { useRef } from 'react'

export const MySlider = () => {
  const rootRef = useRef<HTMLDivElement | null>(null)
  return <Slider.Root ref={rootRef}>{/* ... */}</Slider.Root>
}
```

## Solid

In Solid, the `ref` prop can be used to access the rendered element.

```tsx
import { Slider } from '@ark-ui/solid/slider'

export const MySlider = () => {
  let rootRef!: HTMLDivElement
  return <Slider.Root ref={(el) => (rootRef = el)}>{/* ... */}</Slider.Root>
}
```

Alternatively, you can assign refs to Solid.js signals via the `createSignal` function.

```tsx
import { Slider } from '@ark-ui/solid/slider'
import { createSignal } from 'solid-js'

export const MySlider = () => {
  const [rootRef, setRootRef] = createSignal<HTMLDivElement | null>(null)
  return <Slider.Root ref={setRootRef}>{/* ... */}</Slider.Root>
}
```

## Vue

In Vue, pass the `ref` prop to the component to access the rendered element via the `$el` property.

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Slider } from '@ark-ui/vue/slider'

const rootRef = ref<{ $el: HTMLDivElement } | null>(null)
</script>

<template>
  <Slider.Root ref="rootRef">{/* ... */}</Slider.Root>
</template>
```

## Svelte

In Svelte 5, use the `bind:ref` directive to access the rendered element.

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Slider } from '@ark-ui/svelte/slider'

  let rootRef = $state<HTMLDivElement | null>(null)
</script>

<Slider.Root bind:ref={rootRef}>{/* ... */}</Slider.Root>
```

# COLLECTIONS

---

# List Collection

A list collection is a collection that is based on an array of items. It is created by passing an array of items to the
constructor.

```ts
import { createListCollection } from '@ark-ui/react/collection'

const collection = createListCollection({
  items: [
    { label: 'Apple', value: 'apple' },
    { label: 'Banana', value: 'banana' },
  ],
})

console.log(collection.items) // [{ label: 'Apple', value: 'apple' }, { label: 'Banana', value: 'banana' }]
```

### Converting value to item

Use the `find` or `findMany` method to convert a value to an item.

```ts
const item = collection.find('banana')

console.log(item) // { label: "Banana", value: "banana" }

const items = collection.findMany(['apple', 'banana'])

console.log(items) // [{ label: "Apple", value: "apple" }, { label: "Banana", value: "banana" }]
```

### Value Traversal

Use the `getNextValue` or `getPreviousValue` method to get the next or previous item based on a value.

```ts
const nextValue = collection.getNextValue('apple')

console.log(nextValue) // banana

const previousItem = collection.getPreviousValue('banana')

console.log(previousItem) // apple
```

Likewise, use the `firstValue` or `lastValue` computed properties to get the first or last item.

```ts
console.log(collection.firstValue) // apple

console.log(collection.lastValue) // banana
```

### Check for value existence

Use the `has` method to check if a value exists in the collection.

```ts
const hasValue = collection.has('apple')

console.log(hasValue) // true
```

### Working with custom objects

If you are working with custom objects, you can pass a function to the `itemToString` and `itemToValue` options to
specify how to convert an item to a string and a value, respectively.

> By default, we look for the `label` and `value` properties in the item.

```ts
import { createListCollection } from '@ark-ui/react/collection'

const collection = createListCollection({
  items: [
    { id: 1, name: 'apple' },
    { id: 2, name: 'banana' },
    { id: 3, name: 'cherry' },
  ],
  itemToString: (item) => item.name,
  itemToValue: (item) => item.id,
})
```

To mark an item as disabled, pass a function to the `isItemDisabled` option.

> By default, we look for the `disabled` property in the item.

```ts
import { createListCollection } from '@ark-ui/react/collection'

const collection = createListCollection({
  items: [
    { id: 1, name: 'apple' },
    { id: 2, name: 'banana' },
    { id: 3, name: 'cherry' },
  ],
  isItemDisabled: (item) => item.id === 2,
})
```

### Reorder items

Use the `reorder` method to reorder items by passing the starting index and the ending index of the item to be moved.

```ts
const fromIndex = 1 // Banana
const toIndex = 0 // Apple
collection.reorder(fromIndex, toIndex)

console.log(collection.items) // [{ label: "Banana", value: "banana" }, { label: "Apple", value: "apple" }]
```


# Tree Collection

A tree collection is designed to manage hierarchical data structures like file systems, navigation menus, or
organization charts. It provides powerful methods for traversing, manipulating, and querying tree structures.

```ts
import { createTreeCollection } from '@ark-ui/react/collection'

const treeData = {
  value: 'root',
  label: 'Root',
  children: [
    {
      value: 'folder1',
      label: 'Folder 1',
      children: [
        { value: 'file1', label: 'File 1.txt' },
        { value: 'file2', label: 'File 2.txt' },
      ],
    },
    {
      value: 'folder2',
      label: 'Folder 2',
      children: [
        {
          value: 'subfolder1',
          label: 'Subfolder 1',
          children: [{ value: 'file3', label: 'File 3.txt' }],
        },
      ],
    },
  ],
}

const tree = createTreeCollection({ rootNode: treeData })
```

### Navigation Methods

The tree collection provides various methods to navigate through the hierarchical structure.

#### Getting First and Last Nodes

```ts
const firstNode = tree.getFirstNode()
console.log(firstNode?.value) // "folder1"

const lastNode = tree.getLastNode()
console.log(lastNode?.value) // "folder2"
```

#### Sequential Navigation

Navigate to the next or previous node in the tree traversal order:

```ts
const nextNode = tree.getNextNode('file1')
console.log(nextNode?.value) // "file2"

const previousNode = tree.getPreviousNode('file2')
console.log(previousNode?.value) // "file1"
```

### Hierarchical Relationships

#### Parent and Children

Get parent and descendant nodes:

```ts
// Get parent node
const parentNode = tree.getParentNode('file1')
console.log(parentNode?.value) // "folder1"

// Get all ancestor nodes
const ancestors = tree.getParentNodes('file3')
console.log(ancestors.map((n) => n.value)) // ["folder2", "subfolder1"]

// Get all descendant nodes
const descendants = tree.getDescendantNodes('folder1')
console.log(descendants.map((n) => n.value)) // ["file1", "file2"]

// Get descendant values only
const descendantValues = tree.getDescendantValues('folder2')
console.log(descendantValues) // ["subfolder1", "file3"]
```

#### Sibling Navigation

Navigate between sibling nodes:

```ts
// Assuming we have the index path of "file1"
const indexPath = tree.getIndexPath('file1') // [0, 0]

const nextSibling = tree.getNextSibling(indexPath)
console.log(nextSibling?.value) // "file2"

const previousSibling = tree.getPreviousSibling(indexPath)
console.log(previousSibling) // undefined (no previous sibling)

// Get all siblings
const siblings = tree.getSiblingNodes(indexPath)
console.log(siblings.map((n) => n.value)) // ["file1", "file2"]
```

### Index Path Operations

Work with index paths to identify node positions:

```ts
// Get index path for a value
const indexPath = tree.getIndexPath('file3')
console.log(indexPath) // [1, 0, 0]

// Get value from index path
const value = tree.getValue([1, 0, 0])
console.log(value) // "file3"

// Get full value path (all ancestors + node)
const valuePath = tree.getValuePath([1, 0, 0])
console.log(valuePath) // ["folder2", "subfolder1", "file3"]

// Get node at specific index path
const node = tree.at([1, 0])
console.log(node?.value) // "subfolder1"
```

### Tree Queries

#### Branch and Leaf Detection

```ts
// Check if a node is a branch (has children)
const folder1Node = tree.findNode('folder1')
const isBranch = tree.isBranchNode(folder1Node!)
console.log(isBranch) // true

// Get all branch values
const branchValues = tree.getBranchValues()
console.log(branchValues) // ["folder1", "folder2", "subfolder1"]
```

#### Tree Traversal

Visit all nodes with custom logic:

```ts
tree.visit({
  onEnter: (node, indexPath) => {
    console.log(`Visiting: ${node.value} at depth ${indexPath.length}`)

    // Skip certain branches
    if (node.value === 'folder2') {
      return 'skip' // Skip this branch and its children
    }
  },
})
```

#### Filtering

Create a new tree with filtered nodes:

```ts
// Keep only nodes that match criteria
const filteredTree = tree.filter((node, indexPath) => {
  return node.value.includes('file') // Only keep files
})

console.log(filteredTree.getValues()) // ["file1", "file2", "file3"]
```

### Tree Manipulation

#### Adding Nodes

```ts
const newFile = { value: 'newfile', label: 'New File.txt' }

// Insert after a specific node
const indexPath = tree.getIndexPath('file1')
const updatedTree = tree.insertAfter(indexPath!, [newFile])

// Insert before a specific node
const updatedTree2 = tree.insertBefore(indexPath!, [newFile])
```

#### Removing Nodes

```ts
const indexPath = tree.getIndexPath('file2')
const updatedTree = tree.remove([indexPath!])

console.log(updatedTree.getValues()) // file2 is removed
```

#### Moving Nodes

```ts
const fromIndexPaths = [tree.getIndexPath('file1')!]
const toIndexPath = tree.getIndexPath('folder2')!

const updatedTree = tree.move(fromIndexPaths, toIndexPath)
// file1 is now moved under folder2
```

#### Replacing Nodes

```ts
const indexPath = tree.getIndexPath('file1')!
const newNode = { value: 'replacedfile', label: 'Replaced File.txt' }

const updatedTree = tree.replace(indexPath, newNode)
```

### Utility Methods

#### Flattening

Convert the tree to a flat structure:

```ts
const flatNodes = tree.flatten()
console.log(flatNodes.map((n) => ({ value: n.value, depth: n._indexPath.length })))
// [{ value: "folder1", depth: 1 }, { value: "file1", depth: 2 }, ...]
```

#### Getting All Values

```ts
const allValues = tree.getValues()
console.log(allValues) // ["folder1", "file1", "file2", "folder2", "subfolder1", "file3"]
```

#### Depth Calculation

```ts
const depth = tree.getDepth('file3')
console.log(depth) // 3 (root -> folder2 -> subfolder1 -> file3)
```

### Working with Custom Node Types

You can customize how the tree collection interprets your data:

```ts
interface CustomNode {
  id: string
  name: string
  items?: CustomNode[]
  isDisabled?: boolean
}

const customTree = createTreeCollection<CustomNode>({
  rootNode: {
    id: 'root',
    name: 'Root',
    items: [
      { id: '1', name: 'Item 1', isDisabled: false },
      { id: '2', name: 'Item 2', isDisabled: true },
    ],
  },
  nodeToValue: (node) => node.id,
  nodeToString: (node) => node.name,
  nodeToChildren: (node) => node.items,
  isNodeDisabled: (node) => node.isDisabled ?? false,
})
```

### Creating Trees from File Paths

Create a tree structure from file paths:

```ts
import { createFileTreeCollection } from '@ark-ui/react/collection'

const paths = ['src/components/Button.tsx', 'src/components/Input.tsx', 'src/utils/helpers.ts', 'docs/README.md']

const fileTree = createFileTreeCollection(paths)
console.log(fileTree.getBranchValues()) // ["src", "components", "utils", "docs"]
```

> **Good to know**: Tree collections are immutable - all modification methods return a new tree instance rather than
> modifying the original.


# Async List

The `useAsyncList` hook manages asynchronous data operations for list collections. It provides a comprehensive solution
for loading, filtering, sorting, and paginating data with built-in loading states, error handling, and request
cancellation.

```tsx
import { useAsyncList } from '@ark-ui/react/collection'

const list = useAsyncList<User>({
  async load({ signal }) {
    const response = await fetch('/api/users', { signal })
    const users = await response.json()
    return { items: users }
  },
})

console.log(list.items) // User[]
console.log(list.loading) // boolean
console.log(list.error) // Error | null
```

## Examples

### Loading Data

Load data asynchronously from an API using the `load` function and update the list when the data is ready.

**Example: async-list/reload**

#### React

```tsx
import { useAsyncList } from '@ark-ui/react/collection'
import { LoaderIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/async-list.module.css'

interface Quote {
  id: number
  quote: string
  author: string
}

export const Reload = () => {
  const list = useAsyncList<Quote>({
    autoReload: true,
    async load() {
      const response = await fetch(`https://dummyjson.com/quotes?limit=4&skip=${Math.floor(Math.random() * 50)}`)

      if (!response.ok) {
        throw new Error('Failed to fetch quotes')
      }

      const data = await response.json()
      return { items: data.quotes }
    },
  })

  return (
    <div className={styles.Root}>
      <div className={styles.Header}>
        <button className={button.Root} onClick={() => list.reload()} disabled={list.loading}>
          {list.loading ? (
            <>
              <LoaderIcon className={styles.Spinner} /> Loading
            </>
          ) : (
            'Reload Quotes'
          )}
        </button>
      </div>

      {list.error && <div className={styles.Error}>Error: {list.error.message}</div>}

      <div className={styles.ItemGroup}>
        {list.items.map((quote) => (
          <div key={quote.id} className={styles.Item}>
            <div className={styles.ItemContent}>
              <div className={styles.ItemDescription}>"{quote.quote}"</div>
              <div className={styles.ItemMeta}>— {quote.author}</div>
            </div>
          </div>
        ))}
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}

```

#### Solid

      const response = await fetch(`https://dummyjson.com/quotes?limit=4&skip=${Math.floor(Math.random() * 50)}`)

      if (!response.ok) {
        throw new Error('Failed to fetch quotes')
      }

      const data = await response.json()
      return { items: data.quotes }
    },
  })

  return (
    <div class={styles.Root}>
      <div class={styles.Header}>

### Infinite Loading

Implement pagination by returning a cursor that indicates more data is available.

**Example: async-list/infinite-loading**

#### React

```tsx
import { useAsyncList } from '@ark-ui/react/collection'
import { LoaderIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/async-list.module.css'

const LIMIT = 4

interface Post {
  userId: number
  id: number
  title: string
  body: string
}

export const InfiniteLoading = () => {
  const list = useAsyncList<Post, number>({
    autoReload: true,
    async load({ cursor }) {
      const page = cursor || 1
      const start = (page - 1) * LIMIT

      const response = await fetch(`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts?_start=${start}&_limit=${LIMIT}`)

      if (!response.ok) {
        throw new Error('Failed to fetch posts')
      }

      const posts: Post[] = await response.json()
      const hasNextPage = posts.length === LIMIT

      return {
        items: posts,
        cursor: hasNextPage ? page + 1 : undefined,
      }
    },
  })

  return (
    <div className={styles.Root}>
      <div className={styles.Header}>
        <span className={styles.Status}>
          Loaded {list.items.length} posts
          {list.cursor && ` (more available)`}
        </span>
        {list.cursor && (
          <button className={button.Root} onClick={() => list.loadMore()} disabled={list.loading}>
            {list.loading ? (
              <>
                <LoaderIcon className={styles.Spinner} /> Loading
              </>
            ) : (
              'Load More'
            )}
          </button>
        )}
      </div>

      {list.error && <div className={styles.Error}>Error: {list.error.message}</div>}

### Filtering

Filter data based on user input with automatic debouncing and loading states.

**Example: async-list/filter**

#### React

```tsx
import { useAsyncList } from '@ark-ui/react/collection'
import { LoaderIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import field from 'styles/field.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/async-list.module.css'

const LIMIT = 4

interface User {
  id: number
  name: string
  email: string
  department: string
  role: string
}

export const Filter = () => {
  const list = useAsyncList<User>({
    initialItems: mockUsers.slice(0, LIMIT),
    async load({ filterText }) {

### Dependencies

Automatically reload data when dependencies change, such as filter selections or external state.

**Example: async-list/dependencies**

#### React

import { useState } from 'react'
import field from 'styles/field.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/async-list.module.css'

const LIMIT = 5

interface User {
  id: number
  name: string
  email: string
  department: string
  role: string
}

export const Dependencies = () => {
  const [selectedDepartment, setSelectedDepartment] = useState<string>('')
  const [selectedRole, setSelectedRole] = useState<string>('')

  const list = useAsyncList<User>({
    initialItems: mockUsers.slice(0, LIMIT),
    dependencies: [selectedDepartment, selectedRole],
    async load({ filterText }) {
      await delay(400)

      let items = mockUsers

## API Reference

### Props

- **load** (`(params: LoadParams<C>) => Promise<LoadResult<T, C>>`) - Function to load data asynchronously
- **sort** (`(params: SortParams<T>) => Promise<SortResult<T>> | SortResult<T>`) - Optional function for client-side
  sorting
- **autoReload** (`boolean`, default: `false`) - Whether to automatically reload data on mount
- **initialItems** (`T[]`, default: `[]`) - Initial items to display before first load
- **dependencies** (`any[]`, default: `[]`) - Values that trigger a reload when changed
- **initialFilterText** (`string`, default: `''`) - Initial filter text value
- **initialSortDescriptor** (`SortDescriptor | null`) - Initial sort configuration

### Load Parameters

The `load` function receives an object with the following properties:

- **cursor** (`C | undefined`) - Current cursor for pagination
- **filterText** (`string`) - Current filter text
- **sortDescriptor** (`SortDescriptor | null`) - Current sort configuration
- **signal** (`AbortSignal`) - AbortController signal for request cancellation

### Load Result

The `load` function should return an object with:

- **items** (`T[]`) - The loaded items
- **cursor** (`C | undefined`) - Optional cursor for next page

### Sort Parameters

The `sort` function receives an object with:

- **items** (`T[]`) - Current items to sort
- **descriptor** (`SortDescriptor`) - Sort configuration with `column` and `direction`

### Return Value

The hook returns an object with the following properties and methods:

#### State Properties

- **items** (`T[]`) - Current list of items
- **loading** (`boolean`) - Whether a load operation is in progress
- **error** (`Error | null`) - Any error from the last operation
- **cursor** (`C | undefined`) - Current cursor for pagination
- **filterText** (`string`) - Current filter text
- **sortDescriptor** (`SortDescriptor | null`) - Current sort configuration

#### Methods

- **reload** (`() => void`) - Reload data from the beginning
- **loadMore** (`() => void`) - Load more items (when cursor is available)
- **setFilterText** (`(text: string) => void`) - Set filter text and reload
- **sort** (`(descriptor: SortDescriptor) => void`) - Apply sorting

#### Types

```tsx
interface SortDescriptor {
  column: string
  direction: 'ascending' | 'descending'
}

interface LoadParams<C> {
  cursor?: C
  filterText: string
  sortDescriptor?: SortDescriptor | null
  signal: AbortSignal
}

interface LoadResult<T, C> {
  items: T[]
  cursor?: C
}
```


# List Selection

The `useListSelection` hook manages selection state in lists and collections. It supports single and multiple selection
modes with operations like select, deselect, toggle, and clear.

```tsx
import { createListCollection, useListSelection } from '@ark-ui/react/collection'

const collection = createListCollection({
  items: [
    { label: 'Apple', value: 'apple' },
    { label: 'Banana', value: 'banana' },
    { label: 'Cherry', value: 'cherry' },
  ],
})

const selection = useListSelection({
  collection,
  selectionMode: 'single',
  deselectable: true,
})

console.log(selection.selectedValues) // ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
```

## Examples

### Basic

By default, the hook supports single selection mode that can be deselected.

> Set `deselectable` to `false` to prevent deselecting the current selection.

**Example: list-selection/basic**

#### React

```tsx
import { createListCollection, useListSelection } from '@ark-ui/react/collection'
import styles from 'styles/list-selection.module.css'

export const Basic = () => {
  const collection = createListCollection({
    items: [
      { label: 'React', value: 'react' },
      { label: 'Vue', value: 'vue' },
      { label: 'Angular', value: 'angular' },
      { label: 'Svelte', value: 'svelte' },
    ],
  })

  const selection = useListSelection({ collection })

  return (
    <div className={styles.Root}>
      <output>Selected: {selection.selectedValues.join(', ') || 'None'}</output>
      {collection.items.map((item) => (
        <label key={item.value} className={styles.Item} data-selected={selection.isSelected(item.value) || undefined}>
          <input
            type="checkbox"
            className={styles.Checkbox}
            checked={selection.isSelected(item.value)}
            onChange={() => selection.select(item.value)}
          />
          <span className={styles.ItemText}>{item.label}</span>
        </label>
      ))}
    </div>
  )
}

```

      { label: 'Angular', value: 'angular' },
      { label: 'Svelte', value: 'svelte' },
    ],
  })

  const selection = useListSelection({ collection })

  return (

    selectionMode: 'multiple',
  })

  const handleSelectAll = () => {
    if (selection.isAllSelected()) {
      selection.clear()
    } else {
      selection.setSelectedValues(collection.getValues())
    }
  }

  return (
    <div className={styles.Root}>
      <div className={styles.Header}>
        <span className={styles.Count}>
          {selection.selectedValues.length} of {collection.items.length} selected
        </span>
        <button type="button" className={styles.SelectAllButton} onClick={handleSelectAll}>
          {selection.isAllSelected() ? 'Deselect all' : 'Select all'}
        </button>
      </div>
      {collection.items.map((item) => (
        <label key={item.value} className={styles.Item} data-selected={selection.isSelected(item.value) || undefined}>
          <input
            type="checkbox"

### Range Selection

Here's an example of how to implement range selection that extends the selection from the first selected item to the
clicked item.

**Example: list-selection/range**

#### React

```tsx
import { createListCollection, useListSelection } from '@ark-ui/react/collection'
import styles from 'styles/list-selection.module.css'

export const Range = () => {
  const collection = createListCollection({
    items: [
      { label: 'React', value: 'react' },
      { label: 'Vue', value: 'vue' },
      { label: 'Angular', value: 'angular' },
      { label: 'Svelte', value: 'svelte' },
      { label: 'Solid', value: 'solid' },
    ],
  })

  const selection = useListSelection({
    collection,
    selectionMode: 'multiple',
  })

  const handleItemClick = (value: string, event: React.MouseEvent) => {
    if (event.shiftKey && selection.firstSelectedValue) {
      selection.extend(selection.firstSelectedValue, value)
    } else if (event.ctrlKey || event.metaKey) {
      selection.toggle(value)
    } else {
      selection.replace(value)
    }
  }

  return (
    <div className={styles.Root}>
      <output>Selected: {selection.selectedValues.join(', ') || 'None'}</output>
      {collection.items.map((item) => (
        <label
          key={item.value}
          className={styles.Item}
          data-selected={selection.isSelected(item.value) || undefined}
          onClick={(e) => handleItemClick(item.value, e)}
        >
          <input type="checkbox" className={styles.Checkbox} checked={selection.isSelected(item.value)} />
          <span className={styles.ItemText}>{item.label}</span>
        </label>
      ))}
      <p className={styles.HelperText}>Click to select • Shift+Click for range • Cmd/Ctrl+Click to toggle</p>
    </div>
  )
}

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { createListCollection, useListSelection } from '@ark-ui/solid/collection'
import { For } from 'solid-js'
import styles from 'styles/list-selection.module.css'

export const Range = () => {

    items: [
      { label: 'React', value: 'react' },
      { label: 'Vue', value: 'vue' },
      { label: 'Angular', value: 'angular' },
      { label: 'Svelte', value: 'svelte' },
      { label: 'Solid', value: 'solid' },
    ],
  })

  const selection = useListSelection({
    collection,
    selectionMode: 'multiple',
  })

  const handleItemClick = (value: string, event: MouseEvent) => {
    const firstSelectedValue = selection.firstSelectedValue()
    if (event.shiftKey && firstSelectedValue) {
      selection.extend(firstSelectedValue, value)
    } else if (event.ctrlKey || event.metaKey) {
      selection.toggle(value)
    } else {
      selection.replace(value)
    }
  }

  return (
    <div class={styles.Root}>
      <output>Selected: {selection.selectedValues().join(', ') || 'None'}</output>
      <For each={collection.items}>
        {(item) => (
          <label
            class={styles.Item}
            data-selected={selection.isSelected(item.value) || undefined}
            onClick={(e) => handleItemClick(item.value, e)}
          >
            <input type="checkbox" class={styles.Checkbox} checked={selection.isSelected(item.value)} />
            <span class={styles.ItemText}>{item.label}</span>
          </label>
        )}
      </For>
      <p class={styles.HelperText}>Click to select • Shift+Click for range • Cmd/Ctrl+Click to toggle</p>
    </div>
  )
}

```

#### Vue

```vue

## Anatomy



```tsx
<Accordion.Root>
  <Accordion.Item>
    <Accordion.ItemTrigger>
      <Accordion.ItemIndicator />
    </Accordion.ItemTrigger>
    <Accordion.ItemContent />
  </Accordion.Item>
</Accordion.Root>
```

## Examples

### Default Value

Set the `defaultValue` prop to specify which item should be expanded by default.

**Example: basic**

#### React

```tsx
import { Accordion } from '@ark-ui/react/accordion'
import { ChevronDownIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import styles from 'styles/accordion.module.css'

export const Basic = () => {
  return (
    <Accordion.Root className={styles.Root} defaultValue={['ark-ui']}>
      {items.map((item) => (
        <Accordion.Item className={styles.Item} key={item.value} value={item.value}>
          <Accordion.ItemTrigger className={styles.ItemTrigger}>
            {item.title}

Use the `value` and `onValueChange` props to control the expanded items.

**Example: controlled**

#### React

import { Accordion } from '@ark-ui/react/accordion'
import { ChevronDownIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import { useState } from 'react'
import styles from 'styles/accordion.module.css'

export const Controlled = () => {
  const [value, setValue] = useState<string[]>([])

  return (
    <Accordion.Root className={styles.Root} value={value} onValueChange={(details) => setValue(details.value)}>
      {items.map((item) => (
        <Accordion.Item className={styles.Item} key={item.value} value={item.value}>
          <Accordion.ItemTrigger className={styles.ItemTrigger}>
            {item.title}
            <Accordion.ItemIndicator className={styles.ItemIndicator}>
              <ChevronDownIcon />
            </Accordion.ItemIndicator>
          </Accordion.ItemTrigger>
          <Accordion.ItemContent className={styles.ItemContent}>
            <div className={styles.ItemBody}>{item.content}</div>
          </Accordion.ItemContent>
        </Accordion.Item>
      ))}
    </Accordion.Root>
  )
}

const items = [
  {
    value: 'ark-ui',
    title: 'What is Ark UI?',
    content: 'A headless component library for building accessible web apps.',
  },
  {
    value: 'getting-started',

import styles from 'styles/accordion.module.css'

export const Controlled = () => {
  const [value, setValue] = createSignal<string[]>([])

  return (

      <Index each={items}>
        {(item) => (
          <Accordion.Item class={styles.Item} value={item().value}>
            <Accordion.ItemTrigger class={styles.ItemTrigger}>
              {item().title}
              <Accordion.ItemIndicator class={styles.ItemIndicator}>

              </Accordion.ItemIndicator>
            </Accordion.ItemTrigger>
            <Accordion.ItemContent class={styles.ItemContent}>

            </Accordion.ItemContent>
          </Accordion.Item>
        )}

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Accordion } from '@ark-ui/vue/accordion'
import { ChevronDownIcon } from 'lucide-vue-next'
import { ref } from 'vue'
import styles from 'styles/accordion.module.css'

const value = ref<string[]>([])

const items = [
  {
    value: 'ark-ui',
    title: 'What is Ark UI?',
    content: 'A headless component library for building accessible web apps.',
  },
  {
    value: 'getting-started',

]
</script>

<template>
  <Accordion.Root :class="styles.Root" v-model="value">
    <Accordion.Item v-for="item in items" :key="item.value" :class="styles.Item" :value="item.value">
      <Accordion.ItemTrigger :class="styles.ItemTrigger">
        {{ item.title }}
        <Accordion.ItemIndicator :class="styles.ItemIndicator">
          <ChevronDownIcon />
        </Accordion.ItemIndicator>

        <div :class="styles.ItemBody">{{ item.content }}</div>
      </Accordion.ItemContent>
    </Accordion.Item>
  </Accordion.Root>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Accordion } from '@ark-ui/svelte/accordion'
  import { ChevronDownIcon } from 'lucide-svelte'
  import styles from 'styles/accordion.module.css'

  let value = $state<string[]>([])

  const items = [
    {
      value: 'ark-ui',
      title: 'What is Ark UI?',
      content: 'A headless component library for building accessible web apps.',
    },
    {
      value: 'getting-started',
      title: 'How to get started?',
      content: 'Install the package and import the components you need.',
    },
    {
      value: 'maintainers',
      title: 'Who maintains this project?',
      content: 'Ark UI is maintained by the Chakra UI team.',
    },
  ]
</script>

<Accordion.Root class={styles.Root} bind:value>
  {#each items as item (item.value)}
    <Accordion.Item class={styles.Item} value={item.value}>
      <Accordion.ItemTrigger class={styles.ItemTrigger}>
        {item.title}
        <Accordion.ItemIndicator class={styles.ItemIndicator}>
          <ChevronDownIcon />
        </Accordion.ItemIndicator>
      </Accordion.ItemTrigger>
      <Accordion.ItemContent class={styles.ItemContent}>
        <div class={styles.ItemBody}>{item.content}</div>
      </Accordion.ItemContent>
    </Accordion.Item>
  {/each}
</Accordion.Root>

```

### Root Provider

An alternative way to control the accordion is to use the `RootProvider` component and the `useAccordion` hook. This way
you can access the state and methods from outside the component.

**Example: root-provider**

#### React

```tsx
import { Accordion, useAccordion } from '@ark-ui/react/accordion'
import { ChevronDownIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import styles from 'styles/accordion.module.css'

export const RootProvider = () => {
  const accordion = useAccordion({
    multiple: true,
    defaultValue: ['ark-ui'],
  })

  return (
    <div className="stack">
      <output>Value: {JSON.stringify(accordion.value)}</output>

      <Accordion.RootProvider className={styles.Root} value={accordion}>
        {items.map((item) => (
          <Accordion.Item className={styles.Item} key={item.value} value={item.value}>
            <Accordion.ItemTrigger className={styles.ItemTrigger}>
              {item.title}
              <Accordion.ItemIndicator className={styles.ItemIndicator}>
                <ChevronDownIcon />
              </Accordion.ItemIndicator>
            </Accordion.ItemTrigger>
            <Accordion.ItemContent className={styles.ItemContent}>
              <div className={styles.ItemBody}>{item.content}</div>
            </Accordion.ItemContent>
          </Accordion.Item>
        ))}
      </Accordion.RootProvider>
    </div>
  )
}

const items = [
  {
    value: 'ark-ui',
    title: 'What is Ark UI?',
    content: 'A headless component library for building accessible web apps.',
  },
  {
    value: 'getting-started',
    title: 'How to get started?',
    content: 'Install the package and import the components you need.',
  },
  {
    value: 'maintainers',
    title: 'Who maintains this project?',
    content: 'Ark UI is maintained by the Chakra UI team.',
  },
]

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Accordion, useAccordion } from '@ark-ui/solid/accordion'
import { ChevronDownIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { Index } from 'solid-js'
import styles from 'styles/accordion.module.css'

  const accordion = useAccordion({
    multiple: true,
    defaultValue: ['ark-ui'],
  })

  return (
    <div class="stack">
      <output>Value: {JSON.stringify(accordion().value)}</output>

      <Accordion.RootProvider class={styles.Root} value={accordion}>
        <Index each={items}>
          {(item) => (
            <Accordion.Item class={styles.Item} value={item().value}>
              <Accordion.ItemTrigger class={styles.ItemTrigger}>
                {item().title}
                <Accordion.ItemIndicator class={styles.ItemIndicator}>

      </Accordion.Item>
    {/each}

```

### Collapsible

Use the `collapsible` prop to allow the user to collapse all panels.

**Example: collapsible**

#### React

```tsx
import { Accordion } from '@ark-ui/react/accordion'
import { ChevronDownIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import styles from 'styles/accordion.module.css'

export const Collapsible = () => {
  return (
    <Accordion.Root className={styles.Root} defaultValue={['ark-ui']} collapsible>
      {items.map((item) => (
        <Accordion.Item className={styles.Item} key={item.value} value={item.value}>
          <Accordion.ItemTrigger className={styles.ItemTrigger}>
            {item.title}

### Multiple

Use the `multiple` prop to allow multiple panels to be expanded simultaneously.

**Example: multiple**

#### React

```tsx
import { Accordion } from '@ark-ui/react/accordion'
import { ChevronDownIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import styles from 'styles/accordion.module.css'

export const Multiple = () => {
  return (
    <Accordion.Root className={styles.Root} defaultValue={['ark-ui']} multiple>

<Accordion.Root class={styles.Root} defaultValue={['ark-ui']} multiple>
  {#each items as item (item.value)}
    <Accordion.Item class={styles.Item} value={item.value}>
      <Accordion.ItemTrigger class={styles.ItemTrigger}>

    </Accordion.Item>
  {/each}
</Accordion.Root>

```

### Horizontal

By default, the Accordion is oriented vertically. Use the `orientation` prop to switch to a horizontal layout.

**Example: horizontal**

#### React

```tsx
import { Accordion } from '@ark-ui/react/accordion'
import styles from 'styles/accordion.module.css'

export const Horizontal = () => {
  return (
    <Accordion.Root className={styles.Root} defaultValue={['ark-ui']} orientation="horizontal">
      {items.map((item) => (
        <Accordion.Item className={styles.Item} key={item.value} value={item.value}>
          <Accordion.ItemTrigger className={styles.ItemTrigger}>{item.title}</Accordion.ItemTrigger>
          <Accordion.ItemContent className={styles.ItemContent}>
            <div className={`${styles.ItemBody} ${styles.Centered}`}>{item.content}</div>
          </Accordion.ItemContent>
        </Accordion.Item>
      ))}
    </Accordion.Root>
  )
}

const items = [
  {
    value: 'ark-ui',
    title: 'What is Ark UI?',
    content: 'A headless component library for building accessible web apps.',
  },
  {
    value: 'getting-started',
    title: 'How to get started?',
    content: 'Install the package and import the components you need.',
  },
  {
    value: 'maintainers',
    title: 'Who maintains this project?',
    content: 'Ark UI is maintained by the Chakra UI team.',
  },
]

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Accordion } from '@ark-ui/solid/accordion'
import { Index } from 'solid-js'
import styles from 'styles/accordion.module.css'

export const Horizontal = () => {
  return (
    <Accordion.Root class={styles.Root} defaultValue={['ark-ui']} orientation="horizontal">
      <Index each={items}>
        {(item) => (
          <Accordion.Item class={styles.Item} value={item().value}>
            <Accordion.ItemTrigger class={styles.ItemTrigger}>{item().title}</Accordion.ItemTrigger>
            <Accordion.ItemContent class={styles.ItemContent}>
              <div class={`${styles.ItemBody} ${styles.Centered}`}>{item().content}</div>
            </Accordion.ItemContent>
          </Accordion.Item>
        )}
      </Index>
    </Accordion.Root>
  )
}

const items = [
  {
    value: 'ark-ui',
    title: 'What is Ark UI?',
    content: 'A headless component library for building accessible web apps.',
  },
  {
    value: 'getting-started',
    title: 'How to get started?',
    content: 'Install the package and import the components you need.',
  },
  {
    value: 'maintainers',
    title: 'Who maintains this project?',
    content: 'Ark UI is maintained by the Chakra UI team.',
  },
]

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">

    title: 'Who maintains this project?',
    content: 'Ark UI is maintained by the Chakra UI team.',
  },
]
</script>

<template>
  <Accordion.Root :class="styles.Root" :defaultValue="['ark-ui']" orientation="horizontal">
    <Accordion.Item v-for="item in items" :key="item.value" :class="styles.Item" :value="item.value">
      <Accordion.ItemTrigger :class="styles.ItemTrigger">{{ item.title }}</Accordion.ItemTrigger>
      <Accordion.ItemContent :class="styles.ItemContent">
        <div :class="[styles.ItemBody, styles.Centered]">{{ item.content }}</div>
      </Accordion.ItemContent>
    </Accordion.Item>
  </Accordion.Root>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Accordion } from '@ark-ui/svelte/accordion'
  import styles from 'styles/accordion.module.css'

  const items = [
    {
      value: 'ark-ui',
      title: 'What is Ark UI?',
      content: 'A headless component library for building accessible web apps.',
    },
    {
      value: 'getting-started',
      title: 'How to get started?',
      content: 'Install the package and import the components you need.',
    },
    {
      value: 'maintainers',
      title: 'Who maintains this project?',
      content: 'Ark UI is maintained by the Chakra UI team.',
    },
  ]
</script>

<Accordion.Root class={styles.Root} defaultValue={['ark-ui']} orientation="horizontal">
  {#each items as item (item.value)}
    <Accordion.Item class={styles.Item} value={item.value}>
      <Accordion.ItemTrigger class={styles.ItemTrigger}>{item.title}</Accordion.ItemTrigger>
      <Accordion.ItemContent class={styles.ItemContent}>
        <div class={`${styles.ItemBody} ${styles.Centered}`}>{item.content}</div>
      </Accordion.ItemContent>
    </Accordion.Item>
  {/each}
</Accordion.Root>

```

### Lazy Mount

Use the `lazyMount` prop to defer rendering of accordion content until the item is expanded. Combine with
`unmountOnExit` to unmount content when collapsed, freeing up resources.

**Example: lazy-mount**

#### React

```tsx
import { Accordion } from '@ark-ui/react/accordion'
import { ChevronDownIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import styles from 'styles/accordion.module.css'

export const LazyMount = () => {
  return (
    <Accordion.Root className={styles.Root} lazyMount unmountOnExit>
      {items.map((item) => (
        <Accordion.Item className={styles.Item} key={item.value} value={item.value}>
          <Accordion.ItemTrigger className={styles.ItemTrigger}>
            {item.title}
            <Accordion.ItemIndicator className={styles.ItemIndicator}>
              <ChevronDownIcon />
            </Accordion.ItemIndicator>
          </Accordion.ItemTrigger>
          <Accordion.ItemContent className={styles.ItemContent}>
            <div className={styles.ItemBody}>{item.content}</div>
          </Accordion.ItemContent>
        </Accordion.Item>
      ))}
    </Accordion.Root>
  )
}

const items = [
  {
    value: 'ark-ui',
    title: 'What is Ark UI?',
    content: 'A headless component library for building accessible web apps.',
  },
  {
    value: 'getting-started',
    title: 'How to get started?',
    content: 'Install the package and import the components you need.',
  },
  {
    value: 'maintainers',
    title: 'Who maintains this project?',
    content: 'Ark UI is maintained by the Chakra UI team.',
  },
]

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Accordion } from '@ark-ui/svelte/accordion'
  import { ChevronDownIcon } from 'lucide-svelte'
  import styles from 'styles/accordion.module.css'

  const items = [
    {
      value: 'ark-ui',
      title: 'What is Ark UI?',
      content: 'A headless component library for building accessible web apps.',
    },
    {
      value: 'getting-started',
      title: 'How to get started?',
      content: 'Install the package and import the components you need.',
    },
    {
      value: 'maintainers',
      title: 'Who maintains this project?',
      content: 'Ark UI is maintained by the Chakra UI team.',
    },
  ]
</script>

<Accordion.Root class={styles.Root} lazyMount unmountOnExit>
  {#each items as item (item.value)}
    <Accordion.Item class={styles.Item} value={item.value}>
      <Accordion.ItemTrigger class={styles.ItemTrigger}>
        {item.title}
        <Accordion.ItemIndicator class={styles.ItemIndicator}>
          <ChevronDownIcon />
        </Accordion.ItemIndicator>
      </Accordion.ItemTrigger>
      <Accordion.ItemContent class={styles.ItemContent}>
        <div class={styles.ItemBody}>{item.content}</div>
      </Accordion.ItemContent>
    </Accordion.Item>
  {/each}
</Accordion.Root>

```

### Context

Use `Accordion.Context` or `useAccordionContext` to access the accordion state.

**Example: context**

#### React

```tsx
import { Accordion } from '@ark-ui/react/accordion'
import { ChevronDownIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import styles from 'styles/accordion.module.css'

export const Context = () => {
  return (
    <Accordion.Root className={styles.Root} defaultValue={['ark-ui']}>
      <Accordion.Context>
        {(context) => (
          <output>
            <div>context.value: {JSON.stringify(context.value)}</div>
            <div>context.focusedValue: {context.focusedValue || 'null'}</div>
          </output>
        )}
      </Accordion.Context>

      {items.map((item) => (
        <Accordion.Item className={styles.Item} key={item.value} value={item.value}>
          <Accordion.ItemTrigger className={styles.ItemTrigger}>
            {item.title}
            <Accordion.ItemIndicator className={styles.ItemIndicator}>
              <ChevronDownIcon />
            </Accordion.ItemIndicator>
          </Accordion.ItemTrigger>
          <Accordion.ItemContent className={styles.ItemContent}>
            <div className={styles.ItemBody}>{item.content}</div>
          </Accordion.ItemContent>
        </Accordion.Item>
      ))}
    </Accordion.Root>
  )
}

const items = [
  {
    value: 'ark-ui',
    title: 'What is Ark UI?',
    content: 'A headless component library for building accessible web apps.',
  },
  {
    value: 'getting-started',
    title: 'How to get started?',
    content: 'Install the package and import the components you need.',
  },
  {
    value: 'maintainers',
    title: 'Who maintains this project?',
    content: 'Ark UI is maintained by the Chakra UI team.',
  },
]

```

## Guides

### Content Animation

Use the `--height` and/or `--width` CSS variables to animate the size of the content when it expands or closes:

```css
@keyframes slideDown {
  from {
    opacity: 0.01;
    height: 0;
  }
  to {
    opacity: 1;
    height: var(--height);
  }
}

@keyframes slideUp {
  from {
    opacity: 1;
    height: var(--height);
  }
  to {
    opacity: 0.01;
    height: 0;
  }
}

[data-scope='accordion'][data-part='item-content'][data-state='open'] {
  animation: slideDown 250ms ease-in-out;
}

[data-scope='accordion'][data-part='item-content'][data-state='closed'] {
  animation: slideUp 200ms ease-in-out;
}
```

# Avatar



## Anatomy



```tsx
<Avatar.Root>
  <Avatar.Fallback />
  <Avatar.Image />
</Avatar.Root>
```

## Examples

### Basic

Display a user's profile image with a fallback.

**Example: basic**

#### React

```tsx
import { Avatar } from '@ark-ui/react/avatar'
import styles from 'styles/avatar.module.css'

export const Basic = () => (
  <Avatar.Root className={styles.Root}>
    <Avatar.Fallback className={styles.Fallback}>PA</Avatar.Fallback>
    <Avatar.Image className={styles.Image} src="https://i.pravatar.cc/300?u=a" alt="avatar" />
  </Avatar.Root>
)

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Avatar } from '@ark-ui/solid/avatar'
import styles from 'styles/avatar.module.css'

export const Basic = () => (
  <Avatar.Root class={styles.Root}>
    <Avatar.Fallback class={styles.Fallback}>PA</Avatar.Fallback>
    <Avatar.Image class={styles.Image} src="https://i.pravatar.cc/300?u=a" alt="avatar" />
  </Avatar.Root>
)

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Avatar } from '@ark-ui/vue/avatar'
import styles from 'styles/avatar.module.css'
</script>

<template>
  <Avatar.Root :class="styles.Root">
    <Avatar.Fallback :class="styles.Fallback">PA</Avatar.Fallback>
    <Avatar.Image :class="styles.Image" src="https://i.pravatar.cc/300?u=a" alt="avatar" />
  </Avatar.Root>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Avatar } from '@ark-ui/svelte/avatar'
  import styles from 'styles/avatar.module.css'
</script>

<Avatar.Root class={styles.Root}>
  <Avatar.Fallback class={styles.Fallback}>PA</Avatar.Fallback>
  <Avatar.Image class={styles.Image} src="https://i.pravatar.cc/300?u=a" alt="avatar" />
</Avatar.Root>

```

### Events

Use `onStatusChange` to listen for loading state changes.

**Example: events**

#### React

```tsx
import { Avatar } from '@ark-ui/react/avatar'
import { useState } from 'react'
import styles from 'styles/avatar.module.css'

export const Events = () => {
  const [status, setStatus] = useState('loading...')

  return (
    <div className="vstack">
      <output>Status: {status}</output>
      <Avatar.Root className={styles.Root} onStatusChange={(e) => setStatus(e.status)}>
        <Avatar.Fallback className={styles.Fallback}>PA</Avatar.Fallback>
        <Avatar.Image className={styles.Image} src="https://i.pravatar.cc/3000?u=a" alt="avatar" />
      </Avatar.Root>
    </div>
  )
}

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Avatar } from '@ark-ui/solid/avatar'
import { createSignal } from 'solid-js'
import styles from 'styles/avatar.module.css'

export const Events = () => {
  const [status, setStatus] = createSignal('loading...')

  return (
    <div class="vstack">
      <output>Status: {status()}</output>
      <Avatar.Root class={styles.Root} onStatusChange={(e) => setStatus(e.status)}>
        <Avatar.Fallback class={styles.Fallback}>PA</Avatar.Fallback>
        <Avatar.Image class={styles.Image} src="https://i.pravatar.cc/3000?u=a" alt="avatar" />
      </Avatar.Root>
    </div>
  )
}

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Avatar } from '@ark-ui/vue/avatar'
import { ref } from 'vue'
import styles from 'styles/avatar.module.css'

const status = ref('loading...')
</script>

<template>
  <div class="vstack">
    <output>Status: {{ status }}</output>
    <Avatar.Root :class="styles.Root" @status-change="(e) => (status = e.status)">
      <Avatar.Fallback :class="styles.Fallback">PA</Avatar.Fallback>
      <Avatar.Image :class="styles.Image" src="https://i.pravatar.cc/3000?u=a" alt="avatar" />
    </Avatar.Root>
  </div>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Avatar } from '@ark-ui/svelte/avatar'
  import styles from 'styles/avatar.module.css'

  let status = $state('loading...')
</script>

<div class="vstack">
  <output>Status: {status}</output>
  <Avatar.Root class={styles.Root} onStatusChange={(e) => (status = e.status)}>
    <Avatar.Fallback class={styles.Fallback}>PA</Avatar.Fallback>
    <Avatar.Image class={styles.Image} src="https://i.pravatar.cc/3000?u=a" alt="avatar" />
  </Avatar.Root>
</div>

```

### Root Provider

An alternative way to control the avatar is to use the `RootProvider` component and the `useAvatar` hook. This way you
can access the state and methods from outside the component.

**Example: root-provider**

#### React

```tsx
import { Avatar, useAvatar } from '@ark-ui/react/avatar'
import { useState } from 'react'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/avatar.module.css'

export const RootProvider = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)
  const avatar = useAvatar()

  return (
    <div className="vstack">
      <button className={button.Root} onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Change Avatar
      </button>

      <Avatar.RootProvider className={styles.Root} value={avatar}>
        <Avatar.Fallback className={styles.Fallback}>PA</Avatar.Fallback>
        <Avatar.Image className={styles.Image} src={`https://i.pravatar.cc/300?u=${count}`} alt="avatar" />
      </Avatar.RootProvider>
    </div>
  )
}

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Avatar, useAvatar } from '@ark-ui/solid/avatar'
import { createSignal } from 'solid-js'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/avatar.module.css'

export const RootProvider = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = createSignal(0)
  const avatar = useAvatar()

  return (
    <div class="vstack">
      <button class={button.Root} onClick={() => setCount(count() + 1)}>
        Change Avatar
      </button>

      <Avatar.RootProvider class={styles.Root} value={avatar}>
        <Avatar.Fallback class={styles.Fallback}>PA</Avatar.Fallback>
        <Avatar.Image class={styles.Image} src={`https://i.pravatar.cc/300?u=${count()}`} alt="avatar" />
      </Avatar.RootProvider>
    </div>
  )
}

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Avatar, useAvatar } from '@ark-ui/vue/avatar'
import { ref } from 'vue'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/avatar.module.css'

const count = ref(0)
const avatar = useAvatar()
</script>

<template>
  <div class="vstack">
    <button :class="button.Root" @click="count++">Change Avatar</button>

    <Avatar.RootProvider :class="styles.Root" :value="avatar">
      <Avatar.Fallback :class="styles.Fallback">PA</Avatar.Fallback>
      <Avatar.Image :class="styles.Image" :src="`https://i.pravatar.cc/300?u=${count}`" alt="avatar" />
    </Avatar.RootProvider>
  </div>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Avatar, useAvatar } from '@ark-ui/svelte/avatar'
  import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
  import styles from 'styles/avatar.module.css'

  const id = $props.id()
  const avatar = useAvatar({ id })

  let counter = $state(0)
  const src = $derived(`https://i.pravatar.cc/300?u=${counter}`)
</script>

<div class="vstack">
  <button class={button.Root} onclick={() => counter++}>Change Avatar</button>

  <Avatar.RootProvider class={styles.Root} value={avatar}>
    <Avatar.Fallback class={styles.Fallback}>PA</Avatar.Fallback>
    <Avatar.Image class={styles.Image} {src} alt="avatar" />
  </Avatar.RootProvider>
</div>

```

## Guides

### Next.js Image

Here's an example of how to use the `Image` component from `next/image`.

```tsx
import { Avatar, useAvatarContext } from '@ark-ui/react/avatar'
import { getImageProps, type ImageProps } from 'next/image'

const AvatarNextImage = (props: ImageProps) => {
  const avatar = useAvatarContext()

  const { hidden, ...arkImageProps } = avatar.getImageProps()
  const nextImage = getImageProps(props)

  return (
    <img
      {...arkImageProps}
      {...nextImage.props}
      style={{
        ...props.style,
        // use visibility instead
        visibility: hidden ? 'hidden' : 'visible',
      }}
    />
  )
}

const Demo = () => {
  return (
    <Avatar.Root>
      <Avatar.Fallback>JD</Avatar.Fallback>
      <AvatarNextImage src="..." alt="" width={80} height={80} />
    </Avatar.Root>
  )
}
```

## Anatomy



```tsx
<Carousel.Root>
  <Carousel.Control>
    <Carousel.PrevTrigger />
    <Carousel.NextTrigger />
  </Carousel.Control>
  <Carousel.ItemGroup>
    <Carousel.Item />
  </Carousel.ItemGroup>
  <Carousel.IndicatorGroup>
    <Carousel.Indicator />
  </Carousel.IndicatorGroup>

## Examples

**Example: basic**

#### React

```tsx
import { Carousel } from '@ark-ui/react/carousel'
import { ArrowLeftIcon, ArrowRightIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import styles from 'styles/carousel.module.css'

const images = [
  { src: 'https://picsum.photos/seed/1/500/300', alt: 'Nature landscape' },
  { src: 'https://picsum.photos/seed/2/500/300', alt: 'City skyline' },
  { src: 'https://picsum.photos/seed/3/500/300', alt: 'Mountain view' },
  { src: 'https://picsum.photos/seed/4/500/300', alt: 'Ocean sunset' },
  { src: 'https://picsum.photos/seed/5/500/300', alt: 'Forest path' },
]

export const Basic = () => {
  return (
    <Carousel.Root className={styles.Root} slideCount={images.length}>

  </Carousel.IndicatorGroup>
</Carousel.Root>

```

### Controlled

To create a controlled Carousel component, you can manage the state of the carousel using the `page` prop and update it
when the `onPageChange` event handler is called:

**Example: controlled**

#### React

```tsx
import { Carousel } from '@ark-ui/react/carousel'
import { ArrowLeftIcon, ArrowRightIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import { useState } from 'react'
import styles from 'styles/carousel.module.css'

const images = [
  { src: 'https://picsum.photos/seed/1/500/300', alt: 'Nature landscape' },
  { src: 'https://picsum.photos/seed/2/500/300', alt: 'City skyline' },
  { src: 'https://picsum.photos/seed/3/500/300', alt: 'Mountain view' },
  { src: 'https://picsum.photos/seed/4/500/300', alt: 'Ocean sunset' },
  { src: 'https://picsum.photos/seed/5/500/300', alt: 'Forest path' },
]

export const Controlled = () => {
  const [page, setPage] = useState(0)

  return (
    <Carousel.Root className={styles.Root} slideCount={images.length} page={page} onPageChange={(e) => setPage(e.page)}>
      <Carousel.Control className={styles.Control}>
        <Carousel.PrevTrigger className={styles.Trigger}>
          <ArrowLeftIcon />
        </Carousel.PrevTrigger>
        <Carousel.ItemGroup className={styles.ItemGroup}>
          {images.map((image, index) => (
            <Carousel.Item className={styles.Item} key={index} index={index}>
              <img src={image.src} alt={image.alt} width="500" height="300" />
            </Carousel.Item>
          ))}
        </Carousel.ItemGroup>
        <Carousel.NextTrigger className={styles.Trigger}>
          <ArrowRightIcon />
        </Carousel.NextTrigger>
      </Carousel.Control>
      <Carousel.IndicatorGroup className={styles.IndicatorGroup}>
        {images.map((_, index) => (
          <Carousel.Indicator className={styles.Indicator} key={index} index={index} />
        ))}
      </Carousel.IndicatorGroup>
    </Carousel.Root>
  )
}

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Carousel } from '@ark-ui/solid/carousel'
import { ArrowLeftIcon, ArrowRightIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { Index, createSignal } from 'solid-js'
import styles from 'styles/carousel.module.css'

const images = [
  { src: 'https://picsum.photos/seed/1/500/300', alt: 'Nature landscape' },
  { src: 'https://picsum.photos/seed/2/500/300', alt: 'City skyline' },
  { src: 'https://picsum.photos/seed/3/500/300', alt: 'Mountain view' },
  { src: 'https://picsum.photos/seed/4/500/300', alt: 'Ocean sunset' },
  { src: 'https://picsum.photos/seed/5/500/300', alt: 'Forest path' },
]

export const Controlled = () => {
  const [page, setPage] = createSignal(0)

  return (
    <Carousel.Root
      class={styles.Root}
      slideCount={images.length}
      page={page()}
      onPageChange={(details) => setPage(details.page)}
    >
      <Carousel.Control class={styles.Control}>
        <Carousel.PrevTrigger class={styles.Trigger}>
          <ArrowLeftIcon />
        </Carousel.PrevTrigger>
        <Carousel.ItemGroup class={styles.ItemGroup}>
          <Index each={images}>
            {(image, index) => (
              <Carousel.Item class={styles.Item} index={index}>
                <img src={image().src} alt={image().alt} width="500" height="300" />
              </Carousel.Item>
            )}
          </Index>
        </Carousel.ItemGroup>
        <Carousel.NextTrigger class={styles.Trigger}>
          <ArrowRightIcon />
        </Carousel.NextTrigger>
      </Carousel.Control>
      <Carousel.IndicatorGroup class={styles.IndicatorGroup}>
        <Index each={images}>{(_, index) => <Carousel.Indicator class={styles.Indicator} index={index} />}</Index>
      </Carousel.IndicatorGroup>
    </Carousel.Root>
  )
}

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Carousel } from '@ark-ui/vue/carousel'
import { ArrowLeftIcon, ArrowRightIcon } from 'lucide-vue-next'
import { ref } from 'vue'
import styles from 'styles/carousel.module.css'

          <Carousel.Item v-for="(image, index) in images" :key="index" :class="styles.Item" :index="index">
            <img :src="image.src" :alt="image.alt" width="500" height="300" />
          </Carousel.Item>
        </Carousel.ItemGroup>
        <Carousel.NextTrigger :class="styles.Trigger">

      </Carousel.IndicatorGroup>
    </Carousel.Root>
  </div>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script>
  import { Carousel } from '@ark-ui/svelte/carousel'
  import ArrowLeftIcon from 'lucide-svelte/icons/arrow-left'
  import ArrowRightIcon from 'lucide-svelte/icons/arrow-right'
  import styles from 'styles/carousel.module.css'

  const images = [
    { src: 'https://picsum.photos/seed/1/500/300', alt: 'Nature landscape' },
    { src: 'https://picsum.photos/seed/2/500/300', alt: 'City skyline' },

  ]
  let page = $state(0)
</script>

  <div>Current page: {page}</div>
  <Carousel.Root class={styles.Root} bind:page slideCount={images.length}>
    <Carousel.Control class={styles.Control}>

        <ArrowLeftIcon />
      </Carousel.PrevTrigger>
      <Carousel.ItemGroup class={styles.ItemGroup}>
        {#each images as image, index}
          <Carousel.Item class={styles.Item} {index}>

          </Carousel.Item>
        {/each}
      </Carousel.ItemGroup>

        <Carousel.Indicator class={styles.Indicator} {index} />
      {/each}
    </Carousel.IndicatorGroup>
  </Carousel.Root>
</div>

```

### Root Provider

An alternative way to control the carousel is to use the `RootProvider` component and the `useCarousel` hook. This way
you can access the state and methods from outside the component.

**Example: root-provider**

#### React

```tsx
import { Carousel, useCarousel } from '@ark-ui/react/carousel'
import { ArrowLeftIcon, ArrowRightIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import styles from 'styles/carousel.module.css'

const images = [
  { src: 'https://picsum.photos/seed/1/500/300', alt: 'Nature landscape' },
  { src: 'https://picsum.photos/seed/2/500/300', alt: 'City skyline' },
  { src: 'https://picsum.photos/seed/3/500/300', alt: 'Mountain view' },
  { src: 'https://picsum.photos/seed/4/500/300', alt: 'Ocean sunset' },
  { src: 'https://picsum.photos/seed/5/500/300', alt: 'Forest path' },
]

export const RootProvider = () => {
  const carousel = useCarousel({ slideCount: images.length })

  return (
    <div className="vstack">
      <output>Page: {carousel.page}</output>
      <Carousel.RootProvider className={styles.Root} value={carousel}>
        <Carousel.Control className={styles.Control}>
          <Carousel.PrevTrigger className={styles.Trigger}>
            <ArrowLeftIcon />
          </Carousel.PrevTrigger>
          <Carousel.ItemGroup className={styles.ItemGroup}>
            {images.map((image, index) => (
              <Carousel.Item className={styles.Item} key={index} index={index}>
                <img src={image.src} alt={image.alt} width="500" height="300" />
              </Carousel.Item>
            ))}
          </Carousel.ItemGroup>
          <Carousel.NextTrigger className={styles.Trigger}>
            <ArrowRightIcon />
          </Carousel.NextTrigger>
        </Carousel.Control>
        <Carousel.IndicatorGroup className={styles.IndicatorGroup}>
          {images.map((_, index) => (
            <Carousel.Indicator className={styles.Indicator} key={index} index={index} />
          ))}
        </Carousel.IndicatorGroup>
      </Carousel.RootProvider>
    </div>
  )
}

```

#### Solid

```tsx

### Autoplay

Pass the `autoplay` and `loop` props to `Carousel.Root` to make the carousel play automatically.

**Example: autoplay**

#### React

```tsx

  { src: 'https://picsum.photos/seed/4/500/300', alt: 'Ocean sunset' },
  { src: 'https://picsum.photos/seed/5/500/300', alt: 'Forest path' },
]

export const Autoplay = () => {

### Pause on Hover

This feature isn't built-in, but you can use the `play()` and `pause()` methods from `Carousel.Context` to implement
pause on hover.

**Example: pause-on-hover**

#### React

```tsx
import { Carousel } from '@ark-ui/react/carousel'
import styles from 'styles/carousel.module.css'

const images = [
  { src: 'https://picsum.photos/seed/1/500/300', alt: 'Nature landscape' },
  { src: 'https://picsum.photos/seed/2/500/300', alt: 'City skyline' },
  { src: 'https://picsum.photos/seed/3/500/300', alt: 'Mountain view' },
  { src: 'https://picsum.photos/seed/4/500/300', alt: 'Ocean sunset' },
  { src: 'https://picsum.photos/seed/5/500/300', alt: 'Forest path' },
]

export const PauseOnHover = () => {
  return (
    <Carousel.Root className={styles.Root} slideCount={images.length} autoplay loop>
      <Carousel.Control className={styles.Control}>
        <Carousel.Context>
          {({ isPlaying }) => (
            <span className={styles.StatusText}>Autoplay is: {isPlaying ? 'playing' : 'paused'}</span>
          )}
        </Carousel.Context>
      </Carousel.Control>
      <Carousel.Context>
        {(api) => (
          <Carousel.ItemGroup
            className={styles.ItemGroup}

### Thumbnail Indicators

Replace default indicator dots with image thumbnails. Render each thumbnail inside `Carousel.Indicator` to create a
visual preview of each slide:

**Example: thumbnail-indicator**

#### React

```tsx
import { Carousel } from '@ark-ui/react/carousel'
import { ArrowLeftIcon, ArrowRightIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import styles from 'styles/carousel.module.css'

  { src: 'https://picsum.photos/seed/4/500/300', alt: 'Ocean sunset' },
  { src: 'https://picsum.photos/seed/5/500/300', alt: 'Forest path' },
]

export const ThumbnailIndicator = () => {
  return (

### Vertical

Add the `orientation="vertical"` prop to `Carousel.Root` to switch the carousel to vertical scrolling. This can be
helpful for displaying vertical galleries or content feeds.

**Example: vertical**

#### React

```tsx
import { Carousel } from '@ark-ui/react/carousel'
import { ArrowDownIcon, ArrowUpIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import styles from 'styles/carousel.module.css'

const images = [
  { src: 'https://picsum.photos/seed/1/500/300', alt: 'Nature landscape' },
  { src: 'https://picsum.photos/seed/2/500/300', alt: 'City skyline' },
  { src: 'https://picsum.photos/seed/3/500/300', alt: 'Mountain view' },
  { src: 'https://picsum.photos/seed/4/500/300', alt: 'Ocean sunset' },
  { src: 'https://picsum.photos/seed/5/500/300', alt: 'Forest path' },
]

export const Vertical = () => {
  return (
    <Carousel.Root className={styles.Root} defaultPage={0} orientation="vertical" slideCount={images.length}>
      <Carousel.ItemGroup className={styles.ItemGroup}>

          {images.map((_, index) => (
            <Carousel.Indicator className={styles.Indicator} key={index} index={index} />
          ))}
        </Carousel.IndicatorGroup>
        <Carousel.NextTrigger className={styles.Trigger}>
          <ArrowDownIcon />

### Dynamic

Manage slides dynamically by storing them in state and syncing the carousel page. Pass the `page` prop and
`onPageChange` handler to `Carousel.Root`, and update `slideCount` when slides are added or removed. This demonstrates
bidirectional state synchronization between your component state and the carousel.

**Example: dynamic-slides**

#### React

```tsx
import { Carousel } from '@ark-ui/react/carousel'
import { ArrowLeftIcon, ArrowRightIcon, PlusIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import { useState } from 'react'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/carousel.module.css'

export const DynamicSlides = () => {
  const [slides, setSlides] = useState([0, 1, 2, 3, 4])
  const [page, setPage] = useState(0)

  const addSlide = () => {
    setSlides((prevSlides) => {
      const max = Math.max(...prevSlides)
      return [...prevSlides, max + 1]
    })
  }

  return (
    <div className="stack">
      <Carousel.Root
        className={styles.Root}
        slideCount={slides.length}
        page={page}
        onPageChange={(details) => setPage(details.page)}
      >
        <Carousel.ItemGroup className={styles.ItemGroup}>
          {slides.map((slide, index) => (
            <Carousel.Item className={styles.Item} key={index} index={index}>
              <div className={styles.Slide}>Slide {slide + 1}</div>
            </Carousel.Item>
          ))}
        </Carousel.ItemGroup>
        <Carousel.Control className={styles.Control}>
          <Carousel.PrevTrigger className={styles.Trigger}>
            <ArrowLeftIcon />
          </Carousel.PrevTrigger>
          <Carousel.IndicatorGroup className={styles.IndicatorGroup}>
            {slides.map((_, index) => (
              <Carousel.Indicator className={styles.Indicator} key={index} index={index} />
            ))}
          </Carousel.IndicatorGroup>
          <Carousel.NextTrigger className={styles.Trigger}>
            <ArrowRightIcon />
          </Carousel.NextTrigger>
        </Carousel.Control>
      </Carousel.Root>
      <button className={button.Root} onClick={addSlide}>

### Scroll to Slide

Use `Carousel.Context` to access the carousel API and call `api.scrollToIndex(index)` to programmatically navigate to a
specific slide. This is useful for creating custom navigation or jump-to-slide functionality.

**Example: scroll-to**

#### React

```tsx
import { Carousel } from '@ark-ui/react/carousel'
import { ArrowLeftIcon, ArrowRightIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/carousel.module.css'

### Slides Per Page

Display multiple slides simultaneously by setting the `slidesPerPage` prop on `Carousel.Root`. Use `api.pageSnapPoints`
from `Carousel.Context` to render the correct number of indicators based on pages rather than individual slides. Add the
`spacing` prop to control the gap between slides.

**Example: slides-per-page**

#### React

```tsx
import { Carousel } from '@ark-ui/react/carousel'
import { ArrowLeftIcon, ArrowRightIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import styles from 'styles/carousel.module.css'

export const SlidesPerPage = () => {
  const slides = Array.from({ length: 6 })

  return (
    <Carousel.Root className={styles.Root} slideCount={slides.length} slidesPerPage={2} spacing="20px">
      <Carousel.Control className={styles.Control}>
        <Carousel.PrevTrigger className={styles.Trigger}>
          <ArrowLeftIcon />
        </Carousel.PrevTrigger>
        <Carousel.NextTrigger className={styles.Trigger}>
          <ArrowRightIcon />
        </Carousel.NextTrigger>
      </Carousel.Control>
      <Carousel.ItemGroup className={styles.ItemGroup}>
        {slides.map((_, index) => (
          <Carousel.Item className={styles.Item} key={index} index={index}>
            <div className={styles.Slide}>Slide {index + 1}</div>
          </Carousel.Item>
        ))}

### Spacing

Control the gap between slides using the `spacing` prop on `Carousel.Root`. Combine it with `slidesPerPage` to create
layouts that show partial previews of adjacent slides.

**Example: spacing**

#### React

```tsx
import { Carousel } from '@ark-ui/react/carousel'
import { ArrowLeftIcon, ArrowRightIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import styles from 'styles/carousel.module.css'

const slides = Array.from({ length: 6 })

export const Spacing = () => {
  return (
    <Carousel.Root className={styles.Root} slideCount={slides.length} slidesPerPage={1.5} spacing="48px">
      <span className={styles.StatusText}>spacing='48px'</span>
      <Carousel.ItemGroup className={styles.ItemGroup}>
        {slides.map((_, index) => (
          <Carousel.Item className={styles.Item} key={index} index={index}>
            <div className={styles.Slide}>{index + 1}</div>
          </Carousel.Item>
        ))}
      </Carousel.ItemGroup>
      <Carousel.Control className={styles.Control}>
        <Carousel.PrevTrigger className={styles.Trigger}>
          <ArrowLeftIcon />
        </Carousel.PrevTrigger>
        <Carousel.Context>
          {(api) => (
            <Carousel.IndicatorGroup className={styles.IndicatorGroup}>
              {api.pageSnapPoints.map((_, index) => (
                <Carousel.Indicator className={styles.Indicator} key={index} index={index} />
              ))}
            </Carousel.IndicatorGroup>
          )}
        </Carousel.Context>
        <Carousel.NextTrigger className={styles.Trigger}>
          <ArrowRightIcon />
        </Carousel.NextTrigger>
      </Carousel.Control>
    </Carousel.Root>
  )
}

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Carousel } from '@ark-ui/solid/carousel'
import { ArrowLeftIcon, ArrowRightIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { Index } from 'solid-js'
import styles from 'styles/carousel.module.css'

            <Carousel.Item class={styles.Item} index={index}>
              <div class={styles.Slide}>{index + 1}</div>
            </Carousel.Item>
          )}
        </Index>
      </Carousel.ItemGroup>
      <Carousel.Control class={styles.Control} data-align="center">
        <Carousel.PrevTrigger class={styles.Trigger}>

                {(_, index) => <Carousel.Indicator class={styles.Indicator} index={index} />}
              </Index>
            </Carousel.IndicatorGroup>
          )}
        </Carousel.Context>
        <Carousel.NextTrigger class={styles.Trigger}>

### Variable Sizes

To allow slides with different widths, set the `autoSize` prop on `Carousel.Root`. This lets each `Carousel.Item` define
its own width, and the carousel will adjust automatically. You can also use the `snapAlign` prop on individual items to
control where each one snaps into view.

**Example: variable-size**

#### React

```tsx
import { Carousel } from '@ark-ui/react/carousel'
import { ArrowLeftIcon, ArrowRightIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import styles from 'styles/carousel.module.css'

const items = [
  { id: '1', width: '120px', label: 'Small' },
  { id: '2', width: '200px', label: 'Medium Size' },
  { id: '3', width: '80px', label: 'XS' },
  { id: '4', width: '250px', label: 'Large Content Here' },
  { id: '5', width: '150px', label: 'Regular' },
]

export const VariableSize = () => {
  return (
    <Carousel.Root className={styles.Root} slideCount={items.length} autoSize spacing="8px">
      <Carousel.Control className={styles.Control}>
        <Carousel.PrevTrigger className={styles.Trigger}>
          <ArrowLeftIcon />
        </Carousel.PrevTrigger>
        <Carousel.NextTrigger className={styles.Trigger}>
          <ArrowRightIcon />
        </Carousel.NextTrigger>
      </Carousel.Control>
      <Carousel.ItemGroup className={styles.ItemGroup}>
        {items.map((item, index) => (
          <Carousel.Item key={item.id} index={index} snapAlign="center">
            <div className={styles.Slide} style={{ width: item.width, height: '6rem' }}>
              {item.label}
            </div>
          </Carousel.Item>
        ))}
      </Carousel.ItemGroup>
      <Carousel.Context>
        {(api) => (
          <Carousel.IndicatorGroup className={styles.IndicatorGroup}>
            {api.pageSnapPoints.map((_, index) => (
              <Carousel.Indicator className={styles.Indicator} key={index} index={index} />
            ))}
          </Carousel.IndicatorGroup>
        )}
      </Carousel.Context>

# Checkbox



## Anatomy



```tsx
<Checkbox.Root>
  <Checkbox.Control>
    <Checkbox.Indicator />
  </Checkbox.Control>
  <Checkbox.Label />
  <Checkbox.HiddenInput />
</Checkbox.Root>
```

## Examples

**Example: basic**

#### React

```tsx
import { Checkbox } from '@ark-ui/react/checkbox'
import { CheckIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import styles from 'styles/checkbox.module.css'

export const Basic = () => (
  <Checkbox.Root className={styles.Root}>
    <Checkbox.Control className={styles.Control}>
      <Checkbox.Indicator className={styles.Indicator}>
        <CheckIcon />
      </Checkbox.Indicator>
    </Checkbox.Control>
    <Checkbox.Label className={styles.Label}>Checkbox</Checkbox.Label>
    <Checkbox.HiddenInput />
  </Checkbox.Root>
)

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Checkbox } from '@ark-ui/solid/checkbox'
import { CheckIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import styles from 'styles/checkbox.module.css'

export const Basic = () => (
  <Checkbox.Root class={styles.Root}>
    <Checkbox.Control class={styles.Control}>
      <Checkbox.Indicator class={styles.Indicator}>
        <CheckIcon />
      </Checkbox.Indicator>
    </Checkbox.Control>
    <Checkbox.Label class={styles.Label}>Checkbox</Checkbox.Label>
    <Checkbox.HiddenInput />
  </Checkbox.Root>
)

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Checkbox } from '@ark-ui/vue/checkbox'
import { CheckIcon } from 'lucide-vue-next'
import styles from 'styles/checkbox.module.css'
</script>

<template>
  <Checkbox.Root :class="styles.Root">
    <Checkbox.Control :class="styles.Control">
      <Checkbox.Indicator :class="styles.Indicator">
        <CheckIcon />
      </Checkbox.Indicator>
    </Checkbox.Control>
    <Checkbox.Label :class="styles.Label">Checkbox</Checkbox.Label>
    <Checkbox.HiddenInput />
  </Checkbox.Root>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Checkbox } from '@ark-ui/svelte/checkbox'
  import { CheckIcon } from 'lucide-svelte'
  import styles from 'styles/checkbox.module.css'
</script>

<Checkbox.Root class={styles.Root}>
  <Checkbox.Control class={styles.Control}>
    <Checkbox.Indicator class={styles.Indicator}>
      <CheckIcon />
    </Checkbox.Indicator>
  </Checkbox.Control>
  <Checkbox.Label class={styles.Label}>Checkbox</Checkbox.Label>
  <Checkbox.HiddenInput />
</Checkbox.Root>

```

### Default Checked

Use the `defaultChecked` prop to set the initial checked state in an uncontrolled manner. The checkbox will manage its
own state internally.

**Example: default-checked**

#### React

```tsx
import { Checkbox } from '@ark-ui/react/checkbox'
import { CheckIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import styles from 'styles/checkbox.module.css'

export const DefaultChecked = () => (
  <Checkbox.Root className={styles.Root} defaultChecked>
    <Checkbox.Control className={styles.Control}>
      <Checkbox.Indicator className={styles.Indicator}>
        <CheckIcon />
      </Checkbox.Indicator>
    </Checkbox.Control>
    <Checkbox.Label className={styles.Label}>Checkbox</Checkbox.Label>
    <Checkbox.HiddenInput />
  </Checkbox.Root>
)

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Checkbox } from '@ark-ui/solid/checkbox'
import { CheckIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import styles from 'styles/checkbox.module.css'

export const DefaultChecked = () => (
  <Checkbox.Root class={styles.Root} defaultChecked>
    <Checkbox.Control class={styles.Control}>
      <Checkbox.Indicator class={styles.Indicator}>
        <CheckIcon />
      </Checkbox.Indicator>
    </Checkbox.Control>
    <Checkbox.Label class={styles.Label}>Checkbox</Checkbox.Label>
    <Checkbox.HiddenInput />
  </Checkbox.Root>
)

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Checkbox } from '@ark-ui/vue/checkbox'
import { CheckIcon } from 'lucide-vue-next'
import styles from 'styles/checkbox.module.css'
</script>

<template>
  <Checkbox.Root :class="styles.Root" defaultChecked>
    <Checkbox.Control :class="styles.Control">
      <Checkbox.Indicator :class="styles.Indicator">
        <CheckIcon />
      </Checkbox.Indicator>
    </Checkbox.Control>
    <Checkbox.Label :class="styles.Label">Checkbox</Checkbox.Label>
    <Checkbox.HiddenInput />
  </Checkbox.Root>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Checkbox } from '@ark-ui/svelte/checkbox'
  import { CheckIcon } from 'lucide-svelte'
  import styles from 'styles/checkbox.module.css'
</script>

<Checkbox.Root class={styles.Root} defaultChecked>
  <Checkbox.Control class={styles.Control}>
    <Checkbox.Indicator class={styles.Indicator}>
      <CheckIcon />
    </Checkbox.Indicator>
  </Checkbox.Control>
  <Checkbox.Label class={styles.Label}>Checkbox</Checkbox.Label>
  <Checkbox.HiddenInput />
</Checkbox.Root>

```

### Controlled

Use the `checked` and `onCheckedChange` props to programatically control the checkbox's state.

**Example: controlled**

#### React

```tsx
import { Checkbox } from '@ark-ui/react/checkbox'
import { CheckIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import { useState } from 'react'
import styles from 'styles/checkbox.module.css'

export const Controlled = () => {
  const [checked, setChecked] = useState<Checkbox.CheckedState>(true)

  return (
    <Checkbox.Root className={styles.Root} checked={checked} onCheckedChange={(e) => setChecked(e.checked)}>
      <Checkbox.Control className={styles.Control}>
        <Checkbox.Indicator className={styles.Indicator}>
          <CheckIcon />
        </Checkbox.Indicator>
      </Checkbox.Control>
      <Checkbox.Label className={styles.Label}>Checkbox</Checkbox.Label>
      <Checkbox.HiddenInput />
    </Checkbox.Root>
  )
}

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Checkbox } from '@ark-ui/solid/checkbox'
import { CheckIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { createSignal } from 'solid-js'
import styles from 'styles/checkbox.module.css'

export const Controlled = () => {
  const [checked, setChecked] = createSignal<Checkbox.CheckedState>(true)
  return (
    <Checkbox.Root class={styles.Root} checked={checked()} onCheckedChange={(e) => setChecked(e.checked)}>
      <Checkbox.Control class={styles.Control}>
        <Checkbox.Indicator class={styles.Indicator}>
          <CheckIcon />
        </Checkbox.Indicator>
      </Checkbox.Control>
      <Checkbox.Label class={styles.Label}>Checkbox</Checkbox.Label>
      <Checkbox.HiddenInput />
    </Checkbox.Root>
  )
}

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Checkbox, type CheckboxCheckedState } from '@ark-ui/vue/checkbox'
import { CheckIcon } from 'lucide-vue-next'
import { ref } from 'vue'
import styles from 'styles/checkbox.module.css'

const checked = ref<CheckboxCheckedState>(true)
</script>

<template>
  <Checkbox.Root :class="styles.Root" v-model:checked="checked">
    <Checkbox.Control :class="styles.Control">
      <Checkbox.Indicator :class="styles.Indicator">
        <CheckIcon />
      </Checkbox.Indicator>
    </Checkbox.Control>
    <Checkbox.Label :class="styles.Label">Checkbox</Checkbox.Label>
    <Checkbox.HiddenInput />
  </Checkbox.Root>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Checkbox } from '@ark-ui/svelte/checkbox'
  import { CheckIcon } from 'lucide-svelte'
  import styles from 'styles/checkbox.module.css'

  let checked = $state(false)
</script>

<Checkbox.Root class={styles.Root} bind:checked>
  <Checkbox.Control class={styles.Control}>
    <Checkbox.Indicator class={styles.Indicator}>
      <CheckIcon />
    </Checkbox.Indicator>
  </Checkbox.Control>
  <Checkbox.Label class={styles.Label}>Checkbox</Checkbox.Label>
  <Checkbox.HiddenInput />
</Checkbox.Root>

```

### Root Provider

An alternative way to control the checkbox is to use the `RootProvider` component and the `useCheckbox` hook. This way
you can access the state and methods from outside the component.

**Example: root-provider**

#### React

```tsx
import { Checkbox, useCheckbox } from '@ark-ui/react/checkbox'
import { CheckIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import styles from 'styles/checkbox.module.css'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'

export const RootProvider = () => {
  const checkbox = useCheckbox()

  return (
    <div className="vstack">
      <Checkbox.RootProvider className={styles.Root} value={checkbox}>
        <Checkbox.Control className={styles.Control}>
          <Checkbox.Indicator className={styles.Indicator}>
            <CheckIcon />
          </Checkbox.Indicator>
        </Checkbox.Control>
        <Checkbox.Label className={styles.Label}>Checkbox</Checkbox.Label>
        <Checkbox.HiddenInput />
      </Checkbox.RootProvider>

      {checkbox.checked ? (
        <button type="button" onClick={() => checkbox.setChecked(false)} className={button.Root}>
          Uncheck
        </button>
      ) : (
        <button type="button" onClick={() => checkbox.setChecked(true)} className={button.Root}>
          Check
        </button>
      )}
    </div>
  )
}

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Checkbox, useCheckbox } from '@ark-ui/solid/checkbox'
import { CheckIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import styles from 'styles/checkbox.module.css'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'

export const RootProvider = () => {
  const checkbox = useCheckbox()

  return (
    <div class="vstack">
      <Checkbox.RootProvider class={styles.Root} value={checkbox}>
        <Checkbox.Control class={styles.Control}>
          <Checkbox.Indicator class={styles.Indicator}>
            <CheckIcon />
          </Checkbox.Indicator>
        </Checkbox.Control>
        <Checkbox.Label class={styles.Label}>Checkbox</Checkbox.Label>
        <Checkbox.HiddenInput />
      </Checkbox.RootProvider>

      {checkbox().checked ? (
        <button type="button" onClick={() => checkbox().setChecked(false)} class={button.Root}>
          Uncheck
        </button>
      ) : (
        <button type="button" onClick={() => checkbox().setChecked(true)} class={button.Root}>
          Check
        </button>
      )}
    </div>
  )
}

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Checkbox, useCheckbox } from '@ark-ui/vue/checkbox'
import { CheckIcon } from 'lucide-vue-next'
import styles from 'styles/checkbox.module.css'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'

const checkbox = useCheckbox()
</script>

<template>
  <div class="vstack">
    <Checkbox.RootProvider :class="styles.Root" :value="checkbox">
      <Checkbox.Control :class="styles.Control">
        <Checkbox.Indicator :class="styles.Indicator">
          <CheckIcon />
        </Checkbox.Indicator>
      </Checkbox.Control>
      <Checkbox.Label :class="styles.Label">Checkbox</Checkbox.Label>
      <Checkbox.HiddenInput />
    </Checkbox.RootProvider>

    <button v-if="checkbox.checked" :class="button.Root" type="button" @click="() => checkbox.setChecked(false)">
      Uncheck
    </button>
    <button v-else :class="button.Root" type="button" @click="() => checkbox.setChecked(true)">Check</button>
  </div>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Checkbox, useCheckbox } from '@ark-ui/svelte/checkbox'
  import { CheckIcon } from 'lucide-svelte'
  import styles from 'styles/checkbox.module.css'
  import button from 'styles/button.module.css'

  const checkbox = useCheckbox()
</script>

<div class="vstack">
  <Checkbox.RootProvider class={styles.Root} value={checkbox}>
    <Checkbox.Control class={styles.Control}>
      <Checkbox.Indicator class={styles.Indicator}>
        <CheckIcon />
      </Checkbox.Indicator>
    </Checkbox.Control>
    <Checkbox.Label class={styles.Label}>Checkbox</Checkbox.Label>
    <Checkbox.HiddenInput />
  </Checkbox.RootProvider>

  {#if checkbox().checked}
    <button type="button" class={button.Root} onclick={() => checkbox().setChecked(false)}>Uncheck</button>
  {:else}
    <button type="button" class={button.Root} onclick={() => checkbox().setChecked(true)}>Check</button>
  {/if}
</div>

```

### Disabled

Use the `disabled` prop to make the checkbox non-interactive.

**Example: disabled**

#### React

```tsx
import { Checkbox } from '@ark-ui/react/checkbox'
import { CheckIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import styles from 'styles/checkbox.module.css'

export const Disabled = () => (
  <Checkbox.Root className={styles.Root} disabled>
    <Checkbox.Control className={styles.Control}>
      <Checkbox.Indicator className={styles.Indicator}>
        <CheckIcon />
      </Checkbox.Indicator>
    </Checkbox.Control>
    <Checkbox.Label className={styles.Label}>Checkbox</Checkbox.Label>
    <Checkbox.HiddenInput />
  </Checkbox.Root>
)

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Checkbox } from '@ark-ui/solid/checkbox'
import { CheckIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import styles from 'styles/checkbox.module.css'

export const Disabled = () => (
  <Checkbox.Root class={styles.Root} disabled>
    <Checkbox.Control class={styles.Control}>
      <Checkbox.Indicator class={styles.Indicator}>
        <CheckIcon />
      </Checkbox.Indicator>
    </Checkbox.Control>
    <Checkbox.Label class={styles.Label}>Checkbox</Checkbox.Label>
    <Checkbox.HiddenInput />
  </Checkbox.Root>
)

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Checkbox } from '@ark-ui/vue/checkbox'
import { CheckIcon } from 'lucide-vue-next'
import styles from 'styles/checkbox.module.css'
</script>

<template>
  <Checkbox.Root :class="styles.Root" disabled>
    <Checkbox.Control :class="styles.Control">
      <Checkbox.Indicator :class="styles.Indicator">
        <CheckIcon />
      </Checkbox.Indicator>
    </Checkbox.Control>
    <Checkbox.Label :class="styles.Label">Checkbox</Checkbox.Label>
    <Checkbox.HiddenInput />
  </Checkbox.Root>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Checkbox } from '@ark-ui/svelte/checkbox'
  import { CheckIcon } from 'lucide-svelte'
  import styles from 'styles/checkbox.module.css'
</script>

<Checkbox.Root class={styles.Root} disabled>
  <Checkbox.Control class={styles.Control}>
    <Checkbox.Indicator class={styles.Indicator}>
      <CheckIcon />
    </Checkbox.Indicator>
  </Checkbox.Control>
  <Checkbox.Label class={styles.Label}>Checkbox</Checkbox.Label>

**Example: indeterminate**

#### React

```tsx
import { Checkbox } from '@ark-ui/react/checkbox'
import { CheckIcon, MinusIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import styles from 'styles/checkbox.module.css'

export const Indeterminate = () => (
  <Checkbox.Root className={styles.Root} checked="indeterminate">
    <Checkbox.Control className={styles.Control}>
      <Checkbox.Indicator className={styles.Indicator}>
        <CheckIcon />
      </Checkbox.Indicator>
      <Checkbox.Indicator className={styles.Indicator} indeterminate>
        <MinusIcon />
      </Checkbox.Indicator>
    </Checkbox.Control>
    <Checkbox.Label className={styles.Label}>Checkbox</Checkbox.Label>
    <Checkbox.HiddenInput />
  </Checkbox.Root>
)

```

#### Solid

```tsx

    <Checkbox.Label class={styles.Label}>Checkbox</Checkbox.Label>
    <Checkbox.HiddenInput />
  </Checkbox.Root>
)

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Checkbox } from '@ark-ui/vue/checkbox'
import { CheckIcon, MinusIcon } from 'lucide-vue-next'
import styles from 'styles/checkbox.module.css'
</script>

<template>
  <Checkbox.Root :class="styles.Root" checked="indeterminate">
    <Checkbox.Control :class="styles.Control">
      <Checkbox.Indicator :class="styles.Indicator">
        <CheckIcon />
      </Checkbox.Indicator>
      <Checkbox.Indicator :class="styles.Indicator" indeterminate>
        <MinusIcon />
      </Checkbox.Indicator>
    </Checkbox.Control>
    <Checkbox.Label :class="styles.Label">Checkbox</Checkbox.Label>
    <Checkbox.HiddenInput />
  </Checkbox.Root>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Checkbox } from '@ark-ui/svelte/checkbox'
  import { CheckIcon, MinusIcon } from 'lucide-svelte'
  import styles from 'styles/checkbox.module.css'
</script>

<Checkbox.Root class={styles.Root} checked="indeterminate">
  <Checkbox.Control class={styles.Control}>
    <Checkbox.Indicator class={styles.Indicator}>
      <CheckIcon />
    </Checkbox.Indicator>
    <Checkbox.Indicator class={styles.Indicator} indeterminate>
      <MinusIcon />
    </Checkbox.Indicator>
  </Checkbox.Control>
  <Checkbox.Label class={styles.Label}>Checkbox</Checkbox.Label>
  <Checkbox.HiddenInput />
</Checkbox.Root>

```

### Field

The checkbox integrates smoothly with the `Field` component to handle form state, helper text, and error text for proper
accessibility.

**Example: with-field**

#### React

```tsx
import { Checkbox } from '@ark-ui/react/checkbox'
import { Field } from '@ark-ui/react/field'
import { CheckIcon, MinusIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import styles from 'styles/checkbox.module.css'
import field from 'styles/field.module.css'

export const WithField = () => (
  <Field.Root className={field.Root} data-inline>
    <Checkbox.Root className={styles.Root}>
      <Checkbox.Control className={styles.Control}>
        <Checkbox.Indicator className={styles.Indicator}>
          <CheckIcon />
        </Checkbox.Indicator>
        <Checkbox.Indicator className={styles.Indicator} indeterminate>
          <MinusIcon />
        </Checkbox.Indicator>
      </Checkbox.Control>
      <Checkbox.Label className={styles.Label}>Label</Checkbox.Label>
      <Checkbox.HiddenInput />
    </Checkbox.Root>
    <Field.HelperText className={field.HelperText}>Additional Info</Field.HelperText>
    <Field.ErrorText className={field.ErrorText}>Error Info</Field.ErrorText>
  </Field.Root>
)

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Checkbox } from '@ark-ui/solid/checkbox'
import { Field } from '@ark-ui/solid/field'
import { CheckIcon, MinusIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import styles from 'styles/checkbox.module.css'
import field from 'styles/field.module.css'

export const WithField = () => (
  <Field.Root class={field.Root} data-inline>
    <Checkbox.Root class={styles.Root}>
      <Checkbox.Control class={styles.Control}>
        <Checkbox.Indicator class={styles.Indicator}>
          <CheckIcon />
        </Checkbox.Indicator>
        <Checkbox.Indicator class={styles.Indicator} indeterminate>
          <MinusIcon />
        </Checkbox.Indicator>
      </Checkbox.Control>
      <Checkbox.Label class={styles.Label}>Label</Checkbox.Label>
      <Checkbox.HiddenInput />
    </Checkbox.Root>
    <Field.HelperText class={field.HelperText}>Additional Info</Field.HelperText>
    <Field.ErrorText class={field.ErrorText}>Error Info</Field.ErrorText>
  </Field.Root>
)

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Checkbox } from '@ark-ui/vue/checkbox'
import { Field } from '@ark-ui/vue/field'
import { CheckIcon, MinusIcon } from 'lucide-vue-next'
import styles from 'styles/checkbox.module.css'
import field from 'styles/field.module.css'
</script>

<template>
  <Field.Root :class="field.Root" data-inline>
    <Checkbox.Root :class="styles.Root">
      <Checkbox.Control :class="styles.Control">
        <Checkbox.Indicator :class="styles.Indicator">
          <CheckIcon />
        </Checkbox.Indicator>
        <Checkbox.Indicator :class="styles.Indicator" indeterminate>
          <MinusIcon />
        </Checkbox.Indicator>
      </Checkbox.Control>
      <Checkbox.Label :class="styles.Label">Label</Checkbox.Label>
      <Checkbox.HiddenInput />
    </Checkbox.Root>
    <Field.HelperText :class="field.HelperText">Additional Info</Field.HelperText>
    <Field.ErrorText :class="field.ErrorText">Error Info</Field.ErrorText>
  </Field.Root>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Checkbox } from '@ark-ui/svelte/checkbox'
  import { Field } from '@ark-ui/svelte/field'
  import { CheckIcon, MinusIcon } from 'lucide-svelte'
  import styles from 'styles/checkbox.module.css'
  import field from 'styles/field.module.css'
</script>

<Field.Root class={field.Root} data-inline>
  <Checkbox.Root class={styles.Root}>
    <Checkbox.Control class={styles.Control}>
      <Checkbox.Indicator class={styles.Indicator}>
        <CheckIcon />
      </Checkbox.Indicator>
      <Checkbox.Indicator class={styles.Indicator} indeterminate>
        <MinusIcon />
      </Checkbox.Indicator>
    </Checkbox.Control>
    <Checkbox.Label class={styles.Label}>Label</Checkbox.Label>
    <Checkbox.HiddenInput />
  </Checkbox.Root>
  <Field.HelperText class={field.HelperText}>Additional Info</Field.HelperText>
  <Field.ErrorText class={field.ErrorText}>Error Info</Field.ErrorText>
</Field.Root>

```

### Form

Pass the `name` and `value` props to the `Checkbox.Root` component to make the checkbox part of a form. The checkbox's
value will be submitted with the form when the user submits it.

**Example: with-form**

#### React

```tsx
import { Checkbox } from '@ark-ui/react/checkbox'
import { CheckIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import styles from 'styles/checkbox.module.css'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'

export const WithForm = () => (
  <form
    style={{ display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column', gap: '1rem', alignItems: 'flex-start' }}
    onSubmit={(e) => {
      e.preventDefault()
      const formData = new FormData(e.currentTarget)
      console.log('terms:', formData.get('terms'))
    }}
  >
    <Checkbox.Root className={styles.Root} name="terms" value="accepted">
      <Checkbox.Control className={styles.Control}>
        <Checkbox.Indicator className={styles.Indicator}>
          <CheckIcon />
        </Checkbox.Indicator>
      </Checkbox.Control>
      <Checkbox.Label className={styles.Label}>I agree to the terms and conditions</Checkbox.Label>
      <Checkbox.HiddenInput />
    </Checkbox.Root>
    <button className={button.Root} data-variant="solid" type="submit">
      Submit
    </button>
  </form>
)

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Checkbox } from '@ark-ui/solid/checkbox'
import { CheckIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import styles from 'styles/checkbox.module.css'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'

export const WithForm = () => (
  <form
    style={{ display: 'flex', 'flex-direction': 'column', gap: '1rem', 'align-items': 'flex-start' }}
    onSubmit={(e) => {
      e.preventDefault()
      const formData = new FormData(e.currentTarget)
      console.log('terms:', formData.get('terms'))
    }}
  >
    <Checkbox.Root class={styles.Root} name="terms" value="accepted">
      <Checkbox.Control class={styles.Control}>
        <Checkbox.Indicator class={styles.Indicator}>
          <CheckIcon />
        </Checkbox.Indicator>
      </Checkbox.Control>
      <Checkbox.Label class={styles.Label}>I agree to the terms and conditions</Checkbox.Label>
      <Checkbox.HiddenInput />
    </Checkbox.Root>
    <button class={button.Root} data-variant="solid" type="submit">
      Submit
    </button>
  </form>
)

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Checkbox } from '@ark-ui/vue/checkbox'
import { CheckIcon } from 'lucide-vue-next'
import styles from 'styles/checkbox.module.css'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'

const handleSubmit = (event: Event) => {
  event.preventDefault()
  const formData = new FormData(event.target as HTMLFormElement)
  console.log('terms:', formData.get('terms'))
}
</script>

<template>
  <form style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; gap: 1rem; align-items: flex-start" @submit="handleSubmit">
    <Checkbox.Root :class="styles.Root" name="terms" value="accepted">
      <Checkbox.Control :class="styles.Control">
        <Checkbox.Indicator :class="styles.Indicator">
          <CheckIcon />
        </Checkbox.Indicator>
      </Checkbox.Control>
      <Checkbox.Label :class="styles.Label">I agree to the terms and conditions</Checkbox.Label>
      <Checkbox.HiddenInput />
    </Checkbox.Root>
    <button :class="button.Root" data-variant="solid" type="submit">Submit</button>
  </form>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Checkbox } from '@ark-ui/svelte/checkbox'
  import { CheckIcon } from 'lucide-svelte'
  import styles from 'styles/checkbox.module.css'
  import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
</script>

<form
  style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; gap: 1rem; align-items: flex-start;"
  onsubmit={(e) => {
    e.preventDefault()
    const formData = new FormData(e.currentTarget)
    console.log('terms:', formData.get('terms'))
  }}
>
  <Checkbox.Root class={styles.Root} name="terms" value="accepted">
    <Checkbox.Control class={styles.Control}>
      <Checkbox.Indicator class={styles.Indicator}>
        <CheckIcon />
      </Checkbox.Indicator>
    </Checkbox.Control>
    <Checkbox.Label class={styles.Label}>I agree to the terms and conditions</Checkbox.Label>
    <Checkbox.HiddenInput />
  </Checkbox.Root>
  <button class={button.Root} data-variant="solid" type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>

```

### Context

Use the `Checkbox.Context` component to access the checkbox's state and methods.

**Example: context**

#### React

```tsx
import { Checkbox } from '@ark-ui/react/checkbox'
import { CheckIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import styles from 'styles/checkbox.module.css'

export const Context = () => (
  <Checkbox.Root className={styles.Root}>
    <Checkbox.Control className={styles.Control}>
      <Checkbox.Indicator className={styles.Indicator}>
        <CheckIcon />
      </Checkbox.Indicator>
    </Checkbox.Control>
    <Checkbox.Context>
      {(checkbox) => <Checkbox.Label className={styles.Label}>Checked: {String(checkbox.checked)}</Checkbox.Label>}
    </Checkbox.Context>
    <Checkbox.HiddenInput />
  </Checkbox.Root>
)

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Checkbox } from '@ark-ui/solid/checkbox'
import { CheckIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import styles from 'styles/checkbox.module.css'

export const Context = () => (
  <Checkbox.Root class={styles.Root}>
    <Checkbox.Control class={styles.Control}>
      <Checkbox.Indicator class={styles.Indicator}>
        <CheckIcon />
      </Checkbox.Indicator>
    </Checkbox.Control>
    <Checkbox.Context>
      {(checkbox) => <Checkbox.Label class={styles.Label}>Checked: {String(checkbox().checked)}</Checkbox.Label>}
    </Checkbox.Context>
    <Checkbox.HiddenInput />
  </Checkbox.Root>
)

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Checkbox } from '@ark-ui/vue/checkbox'
import { CheckIcon } from 'lucide-vue-next'
import styles from 'styles/checkbox.module.css'
</script>

<template>
  <Checkbox.Root :class="styles.Root">
    <Checkbox.Control :class="styles.Control">
      <Checkbox.Indicator :class="styles.Indicator">
        <CheckIcon />
      </Checkbox.Indicator>
    </Checkbox.Control>
    <Checkbox.Context v-slot="checkbox">
      <Checkbox.Label :class="styles.Label">Checked: {{ String(checkbox.checked) }}</Checkbox.Label>
    </Checkbox.Context>
    <Checkbox.HiddenInput />
  </Checkbox.Root>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Checkbox } from '@ark-ui/svelte/checkbox'
  import { CheckIcon } from 'lucide-svelte'
  import styles from 'styles/checkbox.module.css'
</script>

<Checkbox.Root class={styles.Root}>
  <Checkbox.Control class={styles.Control}>
    <Checkbox.Indicator class={styles.Indicator}>
      <CheckIcon />
    </Checkbox.Indicator>
  </Checkbox.Control>
  <Checkbox.Context>
    {#snippet render(api)}
      <Checkbox.Label class={styles.Label}>Checked: {String(api().checked)}</Checkbox.Label>
    {/snippet}
  </Checkbox.Context>
  <Checkbox.HiddenInput />
</Checkbox.Root>

```

### Group

Use the `Checkbox.Group` component to manage a group of checkboxes. The `Checkbox.Group` component manages the state of
the checkboxes and provides a way to access the checked values.

**Example: group**

#### React

```tsx
import { Checkbox } from '@ark-ui/react/checkbox'
import { CheckIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import styles from 'styles/checkbox.module.css'

export const Group = () => (
  <Checkbox.Group className={styles.Group} defaultValue={['react']} name="framework">
    {items.map((item) => (
      <Checkbox.Root className={styles.Root} value={item.value} key={item.value}>
        <Checkbox.Control className={styles.Control}>
          <Checkbox.Indicator className={styles.Indicator}>
            <CheckIcon />
          </Checkbox.Indicator>
        </Checkbox.Control>
        <Checkbox.Label className={styles.Label}>{item.label}</Checkbox.Label>
        <Checkbox.HiddenInput />
      </Checkbox.Root>
    ))}
  </Checkbox.Group>
)

const items = [
  { label: 'React', value: 'react' },
  { label: 'Solid', value: 'solid' },
  { label: 'Vue', value: 'vue' },
]

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Checkbox } from '@ark-ui/solid/checkbox'
import { CheckIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { For } from 'solid-js'
import styles from 'styles/checkbox.module.css'

export const Group = () => (
  <Checkbox.Group class={styles.Group} defaultValue={['react']} name="framework">
    <For each={items}>
      {(item) => (
        <Checkbox.Root class={styles.Root} value={item.value}>
          <Checkbox.Control class={styles.Control}>
            <Checkbox.Indicator class={styles.Indicator}>
              <CheckIcon />
            </Checkbox.Indicator>
          </Checkbox.Control>
          <Checkbox.Label class={styles.Label}>{item.label}</Checkbox.Label>
          <Checkbox.HiddenInput />
        </Checkbox.Root>
      )}
    </For>
  </Checkbox.Group>
)

const items = [
  { label: 'React', value: 'react' },
  { label: 'Solid', value: 'solid' },
  { label: 'Vue', value: 'vue' },
]

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Checkbox } from '@ark-ui/vue/checkbox'
import { CheckIcon } from 'lucide-vue-next'
import styles from 'styles/checkbox.module.css'

const items = [
  { label: 'React', value: 'react' },
  { label: 'Solid', value: 'solid' },
  { label: 'Vue', value: 'vue' },
]
</script>

<template>
  <Checkbox.Group :class="styles.Group" :defaultValue="['react']" name="framework">
    <Checkbox.Root :class="styles.Root" v-for="item in items" :value="item.value" :key="item.value">
      <Checkbox.Control :class="styles.Control">
        <Checkbox.Indicator :class="styles.Indicator">
          <CheckIcon />
        </Checkbox.Indicator>
      </Checkbox.Control>
      <Checkbox.Label :class="styles.Label">{{ item.label }}</Checkbox.Label>
      <Checkbox.HiddenInput />
    </Checkbox.Root>
  </Checkbox.Group>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Checkbox } from '@ark-ui/svelte/checkbox'
  import { CheckIcon } from 'lucide-svelte'
  import styles from 'styles/checkbox.module.css'

  const items = [
    { label: 'React', value: 'react' },
    { label: 'Solid', value: 'solid' },
    { label: 'Vue', value: 'vue' },
  ]
</script>

<Checkbox.Group class={styles.Group} defaultValue={['react']} name="framework">
  {#each items as item (item.value)}
    <Checkbox.Root class={styles.Root} value={item.value}>
      <Checkbox.Control class={styles.Control}>
        <Checkbox.Indicator class={styles.Indicator}>
          <CheckIcon />
        </Checkbox.Indicator>
      </Checkbox.Control>
      <Checkbox.Label class={styles.Label}>{item.label}</Checkbox.Label>
      <Checkbox.HiddenInput />
    </Checkbox.Root>
  {/each}
</Checkbox.Group>

```

### Controlled Group

Use the `value` and `onValueChange` props to programmatically control the checkbox group's state. This example
demonstrates how to manage selected checkboxes in an array and display the current selection.

**Example: group-controlled**

#### React

```tsx
import { Checkbox } from '@ark-ui/react/checkbox'
import { CheckIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import { useState } from 'react'
import styles from 'styles/checkbox.module.css'

export const GroupControlled = () => {
  const [value, setValue] = useState(['react'])
  return (
    <div className="vstack">
      <output>value: {JSON.stringify(value)}</output>
      <Checkbox.Group className={styles.Group} value={value} name="framework" onValueChange={setValue}>
        {items.map((item) => (
          <Checkbox.Root className={styles.Root} value={item.value} key={item.value}>
            <Checkbox.Control className={styles.Control}>
              <Checkbox.Indicator className={styles.Indicator}>
                <CheckIcon />
              </Checkbox.Indicator>
            </Checkbox.Control>
            <Checkbox.Label className={styles.Label}>{item.label}</Checkbox.Label>
            <Checkbox.HiddenInput />
          </Checkbox.Root>
        ))}
      </Checkbox.Group>
    </div>
  )
}

const items = [
  { label: 'React', value: 'react' },
  { label: 'Solid', value: 'solid' },
  { label: 'Vue', value: 'vue' },
]

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Checkbox } from '@ark-ui/solid/checkbox'
import { CheckIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { createSignal, For } from 'solid-js'
import styles from 'styles/checkbox.module.css'

export const GroupControlled = () => {
  const [value, setValue] = createSignal(['react'])

  return (
    <div class="vstack">
      <output>value: {JSON.stringify(value())}</output>
      <Checkbox.Group class={styles.Group} value={value} onValueChange={setValue} name="framework">
        <For each={items}>
          {(item) => (
            <Checkbox.Root class={styles.Root} value={item.value}>
              <Checkbox.Control class={styles.Control}>
                <Checkbox.Indicator class={styles.Indicator}>
                  <CheckIcon />
                </Checkbox.Indicator>
              </Checkbox.Control>
              <Checkbox.Label class={styles.Label}>{item.label}</Checkbox.Label>
              <Checkbox.HiddenInput />
            </Checkbox.Root>
          )}
        </For>
      </Checkbox.Group>
    </div>
  )
}

const items = [
  { label: 'React', value: 'react' },
  { label: 'Solid', value: 'solid' },
  { label: 'Vue', value: 'vue' },
]

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Checkbox } from '@ark-ui/vue/checkbox'
import { CheckIcon } from 'lucide-vue-next'
import { ref } from 'vue'
import styles from 'styles/checkbox.module.css'

const value = ref(['react'])

const items = [
  { label: 'React', value: 'react' },
  { label: 'Solid', value: 'solid' },
  { label: 'Vue', value: 'vue' },
]
</script>

<template>
  <div class="vstack">
    <output>value: {{ JSON.stringify(value) }}</output>
    <Checkbox.Group :class="styles.Group" v-model="value" name="framework">
      <Checkbox.Root :class="styles.Root" v-for="item in items" :value="item.value" :key="item.value">
        <Checkbox.Control :class="styles.Control">
          <Checkbox.Indicator :class="styles.Indicator">
            <CheckIcon />
          </Checkbox.Indicator>
        </Checkbox.Control>
        <Checkbox.Label :class="styles.Label">{{ item.label }}</Checkbox.Label>
        <Checkbox.HiddenInput />
      </Checkbox.Root>
    </Checkbox.Group>
  </div>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Checkbox } from '@ark-ui/svelte/checkbox'
  import { CheckIcon } from 'lucide-svelte'
  import styles from 'styles/checkbox.module.css'

  const items = [
    { label: 'React', value: 'react' },
    { label: 'Solid', value: 'solid' },
    { label: 'Vue', value: 'vue' },
  ]

  let value = $state(['react'])
</script>

<div class="vstack">
  <output>value: {JSON.stringify(value)}</output>
  <Checkbox.Group class={styles.Group} bind:value name="framework">
    {#each items as item (item.value)}
      <Checkbox.Root class={styles.Root} value={item.value}>
        <Checkbox.Control class={styles.Control}>
          <Checkbox.Indicator class={styles.Indicator}>
            <CheckIcon />
          </Checkbox.Indicator>
        </Checkbox.Control>
        <Checkbox.Label class={styles.Label}>{item.label}</Checkbox.Label>
        <Checkbox.HiddenInput />
      </Checkbox.Root>
    {/each}
  </Checkbox.Group>
</div>

```

### Group Provider

Use the `useCheckboxGroup` hook to create the checkbox group store and pass it to the `Checkbox.GroupProvider`
component. This provides maximum control over the group programmatically, similar to how `RootProvider` works for
individual checkboxes.

**Example: group-provider**

#### React

```tsx
import { Checkbox, useCheckboxGroup } from '@ark-ui/react/checkbox'
import { CheckIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import styles from 'styles/checkbox.module.css'

export const GroupProvider = () => {
  const group = useCheckboxGroup({
    defaultValue: ['react'],
    name: 'framework',
  })

  return (
    <Checkbox.GroupProvider className={styles.Group} value={group}>
      {items.map((item) => (
        <Checkbox.Root className={styles.Root} value={item.value} key={item.value}>
          <Checkbox.Control className={styles.Control}>
            <Checkbox.Indicator className={styles.Indicator}>
              <CheckIcon />
            </Checkbox.Indicator>

  { label: 'Vue', value: 'vue' },
]

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Checkbox, useCheckboxGroup } from '@ark-ui/vue/checkbox'
import { CheckIcon } from 'lucide-vue-next'
import styles from 'styles/checkbox.module.css'

const group = useCheckboxGroup({
  defaultValue: ['react'],
  name: 'framework',
})

const items = [
  { label: 'React', value: 'react' },
  { label: 'Solid', value: 'solid' },
  { label: 'Vue', value: 'vue' },

  import { Checkbox, useCheckboxGroup } from '@ark-ui/svelte/checkbox'
  import { CheckIcon } from 'lucide-svelte'
  import styles from 'styles/checkbox.module.css'

      <Checkbox.HiddenInput />
    </Checkbox.Root>
  {/each}
</Checkbox.GroupProvider>

```

### Invalid

Use the `invalid` prop on `Checkbox.Group` to mark the entire group as invalid for validation purposes. This applies the
invalid state to all checkboxes within the group.

**Example: group-with-invalid**

#### React

```tsx
import { Checkbox } from '@ark-ui/react/checkbox'
import { CheckIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import styles from 'styles/checkbox.module.css'

export const GroupWithInvalid = () => (
  <Checkbox.Group className={styles.Group} invalid>
    {items.map((item) => (
      <Checkbox.Root className={styles.Root} value={item.value} key={item.value}>
        <Checkbox.Control className={styles.Control}>
          <Checkbox.Indicator className={styles.Indicator}>
            <CheckIcon />
          </Checkbox.Indicator>
        </Checkbox.Control>
        <Checkbox.Label className={styles.Label}>{item.label}</Checkbox.Label>
        <Checkbox.HiddenInput />
      </Checkbox.Root>
    ))}
  </Checkbox.Group>
)

const items = [
  { label: 'React', value: 'react' },
  { label: 'Solid', value: 'solid' },
  { label: 'Vue', value: 'vue' },
]

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Checkbox } from '@ark-ui/solid/checkbox'
import { CheckIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { For } from 'solid-js'
import styles from 'styles/checkbox.module.css'

export const GroupWithInvalid = () => (
  <Checkbox.Group class={styles.Group} invalid>
    <For each={items}>
      {(item) => (
        <Checkbox.Root class={styles.Root} value={item.value}>
          <Checkbox.Control class={styles.Control}>
            <Checkbox.Indicator class={styles.Indicator}>
              <CheckIcon />
            </Checkbox.Indicator>
          </Checkbox.Control>
          <Checkbox.Label class={styles.Label}>{item.label}</Checkbox.Label>
          <Checkbox.HiddenInput />
        </Checkbox.Root>
      )}
    </For>
  </Checkbox.Group>
)

const items = [
  { label: 'React', value: 'react' },
  { label: 'Solid', value: 'solid' },
  { label: 'Vue', value: 'vue' },
]

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Checkbox } from '@ark-ui/vue/checkbox'
import { CheckIcon } from 'lucide-vue-next'
import styles from 'styles/checkbox.module.css'

const items = [
  { label: 'React', value: 'react' },
  { label: 'Solid', value: 'solid' },
  { label: 'Vue', value: 'vue' },
]
</script>

<template>
  <Checkbox.Group :class="styles.Group" invalid>
    <Checkbox.Root :class="styles.Root" v-for="item in items" :key="item.value" :value="item.value">
      <Checkbox.Control :class="styles.Control">
        <Checkbox.Indicator :class="styles.Indicator">
          <CheckIcon />
        </Checkbox.Indicator>
      </Checkbox.Control>
      <Checkbox.Label :class="styles.Label">{{ item.label }}</Checkbox.Label>
      <Checkbox.HiddenInput />
    </Checkbox.Root>
  </Checkbox.Group>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Checkbox } from '@ark-ui/svelte/checkbox'
  import { CheckIcon } from 'lucide-svelte'
  import styles from 'styles/checkbox.module.css'

  const items = [
    { label: 'React', value: 'react' },
    { label: 'Solid', value: 'solid' },
    { label: 'Vue', value: 'vue' },
  ]
</script>

<Checkbox.Group class={styles.Group} invalid>
  {#each items as item (item.value)}
    <Checkbox.Root class={styles.Root} value={item.value}>
      <Checkbox.Control class={styles.Control}>
        <Checkbox.Indicator class={styles.Indicator}>
          <CheckIcon />
        </Checkbox.Indicator>
      </Checkbox.Control>
      <Checkbox.Label class={styles.Label}>{item.label}</Checkbox.Label>
      <Checkbox.HiddenInput />
    </Checkbox.Root>
  {/each}
</Checkbox.Group>

```

### Select All

Implement a "select all" checkbox that controls all checkboxes within a group. The parent checkbox automatically shows
an indeterminate state when some (but not all) items are selected, and becomes fully checked when all items are
selected.

**Example: group-with-select-all**

#### React

```tsx
import { Checkbox } from '@ark-ui/react/checkbox'
import { CheckIcon, MinusIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import { useState } from 'react'
import styles from 'styles/checkbox.module.css'

const CheckboxItem = (props: Checkbox.RootProps) => {
  return (
    <Checkbox.Root className={styles.Root} {...props}>
      <Checkbox.Control className={styles.Control}>
        <Checkbox.Indicator className={styles.Indicator}>
          <CheckIcon />
        </Checkbox.Indicator>
        <Checkbox.Indicator className={styles.Indicator} indeterminate>
          <MinusIcon />
        </Checkbox.Indicator>
      </Checkbox.Control>
      <Checkbox.Label className={styles.Label}>{props.children}</Checkbox.Label>
      <Checkbox.HiddenInput />
    </Checkbox.Root>
  )
}

export const GroupWithSelectAll = () => {
  const [value, setValue] = useState<string[]>([])

  const handleSelectAll = (checked: boolean) => {
    setValue(checked ? items.map((item) => item.value) : [])
  }

  const allSelected = value.length === items.length
  const indeterminate = value.length > 0 && value.length < items.length

  return (
    <div style={{ display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column', gap: 10 }}>
      <output>Selected: {JSON.stringify(value)}</output>

      <CheckboxItem
        value="all"
        checked={indeterminate ? 'indeterminate' : allSelected}
        onCheckedChange={(e) => handleSelectAll(!!e.checked)}
      >
        JSX Frameworks
      </CheckboxItem>

      <Checkbox.Group
        className={styles.Group}
        style={{ marginInlineStart: '1rem' }}
        value={value}
        name="framework"
        onValueChange={setValue}
      >
        {items.map((item) => (
          <CheckboxItem value={item.value} key={item.value}>
            {item.label}
          </CheckboxItem>
        ))}
      </Checkbox.Group>
    </div>
  )
}

const items = [
  { label: 'React', value: 'react' },
  { label: 'Solid', value: 'solid' },
  { label: 'Vue', value: 'vue' },
]

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Checkbox } from '@ark-ui/solid/checkbox'
import { CheckIcon, MinusIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { For, createSignal, createMemo } from 'solid-js'

        <CheckIcon />
      </Checkbox.Indicator>
      <Checkbox.Indicator class={styles.Indicator} indeterminate>
        <MinusIcon />
      </Checkbox.Indicator>
    </Checkbox.Control>
    <Checkbox.Label class={styles.Label}>{props.children}</Checkbox.Label>
    <Checkbox.HiddenInput />
  </Checkbox.Root>
)

export const GroupWithSelectAll = () => {
  const [value, setValue] = createSignal<string[]>([])

  const handleSelectAll = (checked: boolean) => {
    setValue(checked ? items.map((item) => item.value) : [])
  }

  const allSelected = createMemo(() => value().length === items.length)
  const indeterminate = createMemo(() => value().length > 0 && value().length < items.length)

  return (
    <div style={{ display: 'flex', 'flex-direction': 'column', gap: '10px' }}>
      <output>Selected: {JSON.stringify(value())}</output>

      <CheckboxItem
        checked={indeterminate() ? 'indeterminate' : allSelected()}
        onCheckedChange={(details) => handleSelectAll(!!details.checked)}
      >
        JSX Frameworks
      </CheckboxItem>

      <Checkbox.Group
        class={styles.Group}
        style={{ 'margin-inline-start': '1rem' }}

        <For each={items}>{(item) => <CheckboxItem value={item.value}>{item.label}</CheckboxItem>}</For>
      </Checkbox.Group>
    </div>

### Group Form

Use the `Checkbox.Group` component within a form to handle multiple checkbox values with form submission. The `name`
prop ensures all selected values are collected as an array when the form is submitted using `FormData.getAll()`.

**Example: group-with-form**

#### React

```tsx
import { Checkbox } from '@ark-ui/react/checkbox'
import { CheckIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import styles from 'styles/checkbox.module.css'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'

export const GroupWithForm = () => (
  <form
    className="vstack"
    onSubmit={(e) => {
      e.preventDefault()
      console.log(new FormData(e.currentTarget).getAll('framework'))
    }}
  >
    <Checkbox.Group className={styles.Group} defaultValue={['react']} name="framework">
      {items.map((item) => (
        <Checkbox.Root className={styles.Root} value={item.value} key={item.value}>
          <Checkbox.Control className={styles.Control}>
            <Checkbox.Indicator className={styles.Indicator}>
              <CheckIcon />
            </Checkbox.Indicator>
          </Checkbox.Control>
          <Checkbox.Label className={styles.Label}>{item.label}</Checkbox.Label>
          <Checkbox.HiddenInput />
        </Checkbox.Root>
      ))}
    </Checkbox.Group>
    <button className={button.Root} type="submit">
      Submit
    </button>
  </form>
)

const items = [
  { label: 'React', value: 'react' },
  { label: 'Solid', value: 'solid' },
  { label: 'Vue', value: 'vue' },
]

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Checkbox } from '@ark-ui/solid/checkbox'
import { CheckIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { For } from 'solid-js'
import styles from 'styles/checkbox.module.css'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'

export const GroupWithForm = () => (
  <form
    class="vstack"
    onSubmit={(e) => {
      e.preventDefault()
      console.log(new FormData(e.currentTarget).getAll('framework'))
    }}
  >
    <Checkbox.Group class={styles.Group} defaultValue={['react']} name="framework">
      <For each={items}>
        {(item) => (
          <Checkbox.Root class={styles.Root} value={item.value}>
            <Checkbox.Control class={styles.Control}>
              <Checkbox.Indicator class={styles.Indicator}>
                <CheckIcon />
              </Checkbox.Indicator>
            </Checkbox.Control>
            <Checkbox.Label class={styles.Label}>{item.label}</Checkbox.Label>
            <Checkbox.HiddenInput />
          </Checkbox.Root>
        )}
      </For>
    </Checkbox.Group>
    <button class={button.Root} type="submit">
      Submit
    </button>
  </form>
)

const items = [
  { label: 'React', value: 'react' },
  { label: 'Solid', value: 'solid' },
  { label: 'Vue', value: 'vue' },
]

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Checkbox } from '@ark-ui/vue/checkbox'
import { CheckIcon } from 'lucide-vue-next'
import styles from 'styles/checkbox.module.css'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'

const handleSubmit = (event: Event) => {
  event.preventDefault()
  const formData = new FormData(event.target as HTMLFormElement)
  console.log(formData.getAll('framework'))
}

const items = [
  { label: 'React', value: 'react' },
  { label: 'Solid', value: 'solid' },
  { label: 'Vue', value: 'vue' },
]
</script>

<template>
  <form class="vstack" @submit="handleSubmit">
    <Checkbox.Group :class="styles.Group" :defaultValue="['react']" name="framework">
      <Checkbox.Root :class="styles.Root" v-for="item in items" :key="item.value" :value="item.value">
        <Checkbox.Control :class="styles.Control">
          <Checkbox.Indicator :class="styles.Indicator">
            <CheckIcon />

      </Checkbox.Root>
    </Checkbox.Group>
    <button :class="button.Root" type="submit">Submit</button>
  </form>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Checkbox } from '@ark-ui/svelte/checkbox'
  import { CheckIcon } from 'lucide-svelte'
  import styles from 'styles/checkbox.module.css'
  import button from 'styles/button.module.css'

  const items = [
    { label: 'React', value: 'react' },
    { label: 'Solid', value: 'solid' },
    { label: 'Vue', value: 'vue' },
  ]
</script>

<form
  class="vstack"
  onsubmit={(e) => {
    e.preventDefault()
    console.log(new FormData(e.currentTarget).getAll('framework'))
  }}
>
  <Checkbox.Group class={styles.Group} defaultValue={['react']} name="framework">
    {#each items as item (item.value)}
      <Checkbox.Root class={styles.Root} value={item.value}>
        <Checkbox.Control class={styles.Control}>
          <Checkbox.Indicator class={styles.Indicator}>
            <CheckIcon />
          </Checkbox.Indicator>
        </Checkbox.Control>
        <Checkbox.Label class={styles.Label}>{item.label}</Checkbox.Label>
        <Checkbox.HiddenInput />
      </Checkbox.Root>
    {/each}
  </Checkbox.Group>
  <button class={button.Root} type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>

```

### Fieldset

Use the `Fieldset` component with `Checkbox.Group` to provide semantic grouping with legend, helper text, and error text
support.

**Example: group-with-fieldset**

#### React

```tsx
import { Checkbox } from '@ark-ui/react/checkbox'
import { Fieldset } from '@ark-ui/react/fieldset'
import { CheckIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import styles from 'styles/checkbox.module.css'
import fieldset from 'styles/fieldset.module.css'

export const GroupWithFieldset = () => (

## Guides

### asChild Behavior

The `Checkbox.Root` element of the checkbox is a `label` element. This is because the checkbox is a form control and
should be associated with a label to provide context and meaning to the user. Otherwise, the HTML and accessibility
structure will be invalid.

> If you need to use the `asChild` property, make sure that the `label` element is the direct child of the
> `Checkbox.Root` component.

    </Clipboard.Root>
  )
}

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Clipboard } from '@ark-ui/vue/clipboard'
import { CheckIcon, ClipboardCopyIcon } from 'lucide-vue-next'

        <ClipboardCopyIcon />
      </Clipboard.Indicator>
    </Clipboard.Trigger>
  </Clipboard.Control>
</Clipboard.Root>

```

### Controlled

Control the clipboard value externally by managing the state yourself and using `onValueChange` to handle updates.

**Example: controlled**

#### React

```tsx
import { Clipboard } from '@ark-ui/react/clipboard'
import { CheckIcon, ClipboardCopyIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import { useState } from 'react'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/clipboard.module.css'

export const Controlled = () => {
  const [url, setUrl] = useState('https://ark-ui.com')

  return (
    <div className="stack">
      <Clipboard.Root className={styles.Root} value={url} onValueChange={(details) => setUrl(details.value)}>
        <Clipboard.Label className={styles.Label}>Copy this link</Clipboard.Label>
        <Clipboard.Control className={styles.Control}>
          <Clipboard.Input className={styles.Input} />
          <Clipboard.Trigger className={styles.Trigger}>
            <Clipboard.Indicator className={styles.Indicator} copied={<CheckIcon />}>
              <ClipboardCopyIcon />
            </Clipboard.Indicator>
          </Clipboard.Trigger>
        </Clipboard.Control>
      </Clipboard.Root>

      <button className={button.Root} onClick={() => setUrl('https://chakra-ui.com')}>
        Change Url
      </button>
    </div>
  )
}

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Clipboard } from '@ark-ui/solid/clipboard'
import { CheckIcon, ClipboardCopyIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { createSignal } from 'solid-js'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/clipboard.module.css'

export const Controlled = () => {
  const [url, setUrl] = createSignal('https://ark-ui.com')

  return (
    <div class="stack">
      <Clipboard.Root class={styles.Root} value={url()} onValueChange={(details) => setUrl(details.value)}>
        <Clipboard.Label class={styles.Label}>Copy this link</Clipboard.Label>
        <Clipboard.Control class={styles.Control}>
          <Clipboard.Input class={styles.Input} />
          <Clipboard.Trigger class={styles.Trigger}>
            <Clipboard.Indicator class={styles.Indicator} copied={<CheckIcon />}>
              <ClipboardCopyIcon />
            </Clipboard.Indicator>
          </Clipboard.Trigger>
        </Clipboard.Control>
      </Clipboard.Root>

      <button class={button.Root} onClick={() => setUrl('https://chakra-ui.com')}>
        Change Url
      </button>
    </div>
  )
}

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Clipboard } from '@ark-ui/vue/clipboard'
import { CheckIcon, ClipboardCopyIcon } from 'lucide-vue-next'
import { ref } from 'vue'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/clipboard.module.css'

const url = ref('https://ark-ui.com')
</script>

<template>
  <div class="stack">
    <Clipboard.Root :class="styles.Root" v-model="url">
      <Clipboard.Label :class="styles.Label">Copy this link</Clipboard.Label>
      <Clipboard.Control :class="styles.Control">
        <Clipboard.Input :class="styles.Input" />
        <Clipboard.Trigger :class="styles.Trigger">
          <Clipboard.Indicator :class="styles.Indicator">
            <ClipboardCopyIcon />
            <template #copied>
              <CheckIcon />
            </template>
          </Clipboard.Indicator>
        </Clipboard.Trigger>
      </Clipboard.Control>
    </Clipboard.Root>

    <button :class="button.Root" @click="url = 'https://chakra-ui.com'">Change Url</button>
  </div>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Clipboard } from '@ark-ui/svelte/clipboard'
  import { CheckIcon, ClipboardCopyIcon } from 'lucide-svelte'
  import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
  import styles from 'styles/clipboard.module.css'

  let url = $state('https://ark-ui.com')
</script>

<div class="stack">
  <Clipboard.Root class={styles.Root} bind:value={url}>
    <Clipboard.Label class={styles.Label}>Copy this link</Clipboard.Label>
    <Clipboard.Control class={styles.Control}>
      <Clipboard.Input class={styles.Input} />
      <Clipboard.Trigger class={styles.Trigger}>
        <Clipboard.Indicator class={styles.Indicator}>
          {#snippet copied()}
            <CheckIcon />
          {/snippet}
          <ClipboardCopyIcon />
        </Clipboard.Indicator>
      </Clipboard.Trigger>
    </Clipboard.Control>
  </Clipboard.Root>

  <button class={button.Root} onclick={() => (url = 'https://chakra-ui.com')}>Change Url</button>
</div>

```

### Root Provider

An alternative way to control the clipboard is to use the `RootProvider` component and the `useClipboard` hook. This way
you can access the state and methods from outside the component.

**Example: root-provider**

#### React

```tsx
import { Clipboard, useClipboard } from '@ark-ui/react/clipboard'
import { CheckIcon, ClipboardCopyIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import styles from 'styles/clipboard.module.css'

export const RootProvider = () => {
  const clipboard = useClipboard({ value: 'https://ark-ui.com' })

  return (
    <div className="stack">
      <output>
        value: {clipboard.value}, copied: {String(clipboard.copied)}
      </output>
      <Clipboard.RootProvider className={styles.Root} value={clipboard}>
        <Clipboard.Label className={styles.Label}>Copy this link</Clipboard.Label>
        <Clipboard.Control className={styles.Control}>
          <Clipboard.Input className={styles.Input} />
          <Clipboard.Trigger className={styles.Trigger}>
            <Clipboard.Indicator className={styles.Indicator} copied={<CheckIcon />}>
              <ClipboardCopyIcon />
            </Clipboard.Indicator>
          </Clipboard.Trigger>
        </Clipboard.Control>
      </Clipboard.RootProvider>
    </div>
  )
}

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Clipboard, useClipboard } from '@ark-ui/solid/clipboard'
import { CheckIcon, ClipboardCopyIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import styles from 'styles/clipboard.module.css'

export const RootProvider = () => {
  const clipboard = useClipboard({ value: 'https://ark-ui.com' })

  return (
    <div class="stack">
      <output>
        value: {clipboard().value}, copied: {String(clipboard().copied)}
      </output>
      <Clipboard.RootProvider class={styles.Root} value={clipboard}>
        <Clipboard.Label class={styles.Label}>Copy this link</Clipboard.Label>
        <Clipboard.Control class={styles.Control}>
          <Clipboard.Input class={styles.Input} />
          <Clipboard.Trigger class={styles.Trigger}>
            <Clipboard.Indicator class={styles.Indicator} copied={<CheckIcon />}>
              <ClipboardCopyIcon />
            </Clipboard.Indicator>
          </Clipboard.Trigger>
        </Clipboard.Control>
      </Clipboard.RootProvider>
    </div>
  )
}

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Clipboard, useClipboard } from '@ark-ui/vue/clipboard'
import { CheckIcon, ClipboardCopyIcon } from 'lucide-vue-next'
import styles from 'styles/clipboard.module.css'

const clipboard = useClipboard({ value: 'https://ark-ui.com' })
</script>

<template>
  <div class="stack">
    <output>value: {{ clipboard.value }}, copied: {{ String(clipboard.copied) }}</output>
    <Clipboard.RootProvider :class="styles.Root" :value="clipboard">
      <Clipboard.Label :class="styles.Label">Copy this link</Clipboard.Label>
      <Clipboard.Control :class="styles.Control">
        <Clipboard.Input :class="styles.Input" />
        <Clipboard.Trigger :class="styles.Trigger">
          <Clipboard.Indicator :class="styles.Indicator">
            <ClipboardCopyIcon />
            <template #copied>
              <CheckIcon />
            </template>
          </Clipboard.Indicator>
        </Clipboard.Trigger>
      </Clipboard.Control>
    </Clipboard.RootProvider>
  </div>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Clipboard, useClipboard } from '@ark-ui/svelte/clipboard'
  import { CheckIcon, ClipboardCopyIcon } from 'lucide-svelte'
  import styles from 'styles/clipboard.module.css'

  const clipboard = useClipboard(() => ({ value: 'https://ark-ui.com' }))
</script>

<div class="stack">
  <output>
    value: {clipboard().value}, copied: {String(clipboard().copied)}
  </output>
  <Clipboard.RootProvider class={styles.Root} value={clipboard}>
    <Clipboard.Label class={styles.Label}>Copy this link</Clipboard.Label>
    <Clipboard.Control class={styles.Control}>
      <Clipboard.Input class={styles.Input} />
      <Clipboard.Trigger class={styles.Trigger}>
        <Clipboard.Indicator class={styles.Indicator}>
          {#snippet copied()}
            <CheckIcon />
          {/snippet}
          <ClipboardCopyIcon />
        </Clipboard.Indicator>
      </Clipboard.Trigger>
    </Clipboard.Control>
  </Clipboard.RootProvider>
</div>

```

### Context

Access the clipboard state and methods using `Clipboard.Context`. This provides access to properties like `copied`,
`value`, and `setValue`

> Alternatively, you can use the `useClipboardContext` hook to access the clipboard context.

**Example: context**

#### React

```tsx
import { Clipboard } from '@ark-ui/react/clipboard'
import { CheckIcon, ClipboardCopyIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/clipboard.module.css'

export const Context = () => {
  return (
    <Clipboard.Root className={styles.Root} value="https://ark-ui.com">
      <Clipboard.Label className={styles.Label}>Copy this link</Clipboard.Label>
      <Clipboard.Context>
        {(clipboard) => (
          <button className={button.Root} onClick={() => clipboard.copy()}>
            {clipboard.copied ? <CheckIcon /> : <ClipboardCopyIcon />}
            {clipboard.copied ? 'Copied!' : 'Copy'}
          </button>
        )}
      </Clipboard.Context>
    </Clipboard.Root>
  )
}

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Clipboard } from '@ark-ui/solid/clipboard'
import { CheckIcon, ClipboardCopyIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { Show } from 'solid-js'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/clipboard.module.css'

export const Context = () => {
  return (
    <Clipboard.Root class={styles.Root} value="https://ark-ui.com">
      <Clipboard.Label class={styles.Label}>Copy this link</Clipboard.Label>
      <Clipboard.Context>
        {(clipboard) => (
          <button class={button.Root} onClick={() => clipboard().copy()}>
            <Show when={clipboard().copied} fallback={<ClipboardCopyIcon />}>
              <CheckIcon />
            </Show>
            <Show when={clipboard().copied} fallback="Copy">
              Copied!
            </Show>
          </button>
        )}
      </Clipboard.Context>
    </Clipboard.Root>
  )
}

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Clipboard } from '@ark-ui/vue/clipboard'
import { CheckIcon, ClipboardCopyIcon } from 'lucide-vue-next'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/clipboard.module.css'
</script>

<template>
  <Clipboard.Root :class="styles.Root" default-value="https://ark-ui.com">
    <Clipboard.Label :class="styles.Label">Copy this link</Clipboard.Label>
    <Clipboard.Context v-slot="clipboard">
      <button :class="button.Root" @click="clipboard.copy()">
        <CheckIcon v-if="clipboard.copied" />
        <ClipboardCopyIcon v-else />
        {{ clipboard.copied ? 'Copied!' : 'Copy' }}
      </button>
    </Clipboard.Context>
  </Clipboard.Root>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Clipboard } from '@ark-ui/svelte/clipboard'
  import { CheckIcon, ClipboardCopyIcon } from 'lucide-svelte'
  import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
  import styles from 'styles/clipboard.module.css'
</script>

<Clipboard.Root class={styles.Root} value="https://ark-ui.com">
  <Clipboard.Label class={styles.Label}>Copy this link</Clipboard.Label>
  <Clipboard.Context>
    {#snippet render(clipboard)}
      <button class={button.Root} onclick={() => clipboard().copy()}>
        {#if clipboard().copied}
          <CheckIcon />
          Copied!
        {:else}
          <ClipboardCopyIcon />
          Copy
        {/if}
      </button>
    {/snippet}
  </Clipboard.Context>
</Clipboard.Root>

```

### Copy Status

Use the `onStatusChange` prop to listen for copy operations. It exposes a `copied` property that you can use to display
a success message.

**Example: copy-status**

#### React

```tsx
import { Clipboard } from '@ark-ui/react/clipboard'
import { CheckIcon, ClipboardCopyIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import { useState } from 'react'
import styles from 'styles/clipboard.module.css'

export const CopyStatus = () => {
  const [copyCount, setCopyCount] = useState(0)

  return (
    <Clipboard.Root
      className={styles.Root}
      value="https://ark-ui.com"
      onStatusChange={(details) => {
        if (details.copied) setCopyCount((prev) => prev + 1)
      }}
    >
      <Clipboard.Control className={styles.Control}>
        <Clipboard.Trigger className={styles.Trigger}>
          <Clipboard.Indicator className={styles.Indicator} copied={<CheckIcon />}>
            <ClipboardCopyIcon />
          </Clipboard.Indicator>
          <Clipboard.ValueText />
        </Clipboard.Trigger>
      </Clipboard.Control>
      <p>Copied {copyCount} times</p>
    </Clipboard.Root>
  )
}

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Clipboard } from '@ark-ui/solid/clipboard'
import { CheckIcon, ClipboardCopyIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { createSignal } from 'solid-js'
import styles from 'styles/clipboard.module.css'

export const CopyStatus = () => {
  const [copyCount, setCopyCount] = createSignal(0)

  return (
    <Clipboard.Root
      class={styles.Root}
      value="https://ark-ui.com"
      onStatusChange={(details) => {
        if (details.copied) {
          setCopyCount((prev) => prev + 1)
        }
      }}
    >
      <Clipboard.Control class={styles.Control}>
        <Clipboard.Trigger class={styles.Trigger}>
          <Clipboard.Indicator class={styles.Indicator} copied={<CheckIcon />}>
            <ClipboardCopyIcon />
          </Clipboard.Indicator>
        </Clipboard.Trigger>
      </Clipboard.Control>
      <p>Copied {copyCount()} times</p>
    </Clipboard.Root>
  )
}

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Clipboard } from '@ark-ui/vue/clipboard'
import { CheckIcon, ClipboardCopyIcon } from 'lucide-vue-next'
import { ref } from 'vue'
import styles from 'styles/clipboard.module.css'

const copyCount = ref(0)
</script>

<template>
  <Clipboard.Root
    :class="styles.Root"
    default-value="https://ark-ui.com"
    @status-change="
      (details) => {
        if (details.copied) {
          copyCount += 1
        }
      }
    "
  >
    <Clipboard.Control :class="styles.Control">
      <Clipboard.Trigger :class="styles.Trigger">

</Collapsible.Root>

```

### Disabled

Use the `disabled` prop to disable the collapsible and prevent it from being toggled.

**Example: disabled**

#### React

```tsx
import { Collapsible } from '@ark-ui/react/collapsible'
import { ChevronRightIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import styles from 'styles/collapsible.module.css'

export const Disabled = () => (
  <Collapsible.Root className={styles.Root} disabled>
    <Collapsible.Trigger className={styles.Trigger}>
      System Requirements
      <Collapsible.Indicator className={styles.Indicator}>
        <ChevronRightIcon />
      </Collapsible.Indicator>
    </Collapsible.Trigger>
    <Collapsible.Content className={styles.Content}>
      <div className={styles.Body}>This section is currently unavailable.</div>
    </Collapsible.Content>
  </Collapsible.Root>
)

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Collapsible } from '@ark-ui/solid/collapsible'
import { ChevronRightIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import styles from 'styles/collapsible.module.css'

export const Disabled = () => (
  <Collapsible.Root class={styles.Root} disabled>
    <Collapsible.Trigger class={styles.Trigger}>
      System Requirements
      <Collapsible.Indicator class={styles.Indicator}>
        <ChevronRightIcon />
      </Collapsible.Indicator>
    </Collapsible.Trigger>
    <Collapsible.Content class={styles.Content}>
      <div class={styles.Body}>This section is currently unavailable.</div>
    </Collapsible.Content>
  </Collapsible.Root>
)

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Collapsible } from '@ark-ui/vue/collapsible'
import { ChevronRightIcon } from 'lucide-vue-next'
import styles from 'styles/collapsible.module.css'
</script>

<template>
  <Collapsible.Root :class="styles.Root" disabled>
    <Collapsible.Trigger :class="styles.Trigger">
      System Requirements
      <Collapsible.Indicator :class="styles.Indicator">
        <ChevronRightIcon />
      </Collapsible.Indicator>
    </Collapsible.Trigger>
    <Collapsible.Content :class="styles.Content">
      <div :class="styles.Body">This section is currently unavailable.</div>
    </Collapsible.Content>
  </Collapsible.Root>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Collapsible } from '@ark-ui/svelte/collapsible'
  import { ChevronRightIcon } from 'lucide-svelte'
  import styles from 'styles/collapsible.module.css'
</script>

<Collapsible.Root class={styles.Root} disabled>
  <Collapsible.Trigger class={styles.Trigger}>
    System Requirements
    <Collapsible.Indicator class={styles.Indicator}>
      <ChevronRightIcon />
    </Collapsible.Indicator>
  </Collapsible.Trigger>
  <Collapsible.Content class={styles.Content}>
    <div class={styles.Body}>This section is currently unavailable.</div>
  </Collapsible.Content>
</Collapsible.Root>

```

### Partial Collapse

Use the `collapsedHeight` or `collapsedWidth` props to create a "show more/less" pattern. When set, the content
maintains the specified dimensions when collapsed instead of collapsing to 0px.

We expose the `--collapsed-height` or `--collapsed-width` variables to use in your CSS animations.

**Example: partial-collapse**

#### React

```tsx
import { Collapsible } from '@ark-ui/react/collapsible'
import { ChevronRightIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import styles from 'styles/collapsible.module.css'

export const PartialCollapse = () => (
  <Collapsible.Root className={styles.Root} collapsedHeight="100px">
    <Collapsible.Trigger className={styles.Trigger}>
      Read More
      <Collapsible.Indicator className={styles.Indicator}>
        <ChevronRightIcon />
      </Collapsible.Indicator>
    </Collapsible.Trigger>
    <Collapsible.Content className={styles.Content}>
      <div className={styles.Body}>

### Nested Collapsibles

You can nest collapsibles within collapsibles to create hierarchical content structures.

**Example: nested**

#### React

```tsx
import { Collapsible } from '@ark-ui/react/collapsible'
import { ChevronRightIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import styles from 'styles/collapsible.module.css'

export const Nested = () => (
  <Collapsible.Root className={styles.Root}>
    <Collapsible.Trigger className={styles.Trigger}>
      Getting Started
      <Collapsible.Indicator className={styles.Indicator}>
        <ChevronRightIcon />
      </Collapsible.Indicator>
    </Collapsible.Trigger>
    <Collapsible.Content className={styles.Content}>
      <div className={styles.Body}>

  import { ChevronRightIcon } from 'lucide-svelte'
  import styles from 'styles/collapsible.module.css'

      </Collapsible.Root>
    </div>
  </Collapsible.Content>
</Collapsible.Root>

```

### Lazy Mount

Use `lazyMount` to delay mounting the content until first opened, and `unmountOnExit` to remove it from the DOM when
collapsed. Combining both ensures the component is only in the DOM while expanded.

**Example: lazy-mount**

#### React

```tsx
import { Collapsible } from '@ark-ui/react/collapsible'
import { ChevronRightIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import styles from 'styles/collapsible.module.css'

export const LazyMount = () => (
  <Collapsible.Root className={styles.Root} lazyMount unmountOnExit>
    <Collapsible.Trigger className={styles.Trigger}>
      Session Details
      <Collapsible.Indicator className={styles.Indicator}>
        <ChevronRightIcon />
      </Collapsible.Indicator>
    </Collapsible.Trigger>
    <Collapsible.Content className={styles.Content}>
      <div className={styles.Body}>
        This content is lazily mounted when first opened and removed from the DOM when collapsed.
      </div>
    </Collapsible.Content>
  </Collapsible.Root>
)

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Collapsible } from '@ark-ui/solid/collapsible'
import { ChevronRightIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import styles from 'styles/collapsible.module.css'

export const LazyMount = () => (
  <Collapsible.Root class={styles.Root} lazyMount unmountOnExit>
    <Collapsible.Trigger class={styles.Trigger}>
      Session Details
      <Collapsible.Indicator class={styles.Indicator}>
        <ChevronRightIcon />
      </Collapsible.Indicator>
    </Collapsible.Trigger>
    <Collapsible.Content class={styles.Content}>
      <div class={styles.Body}>
        This content is lazily mounted when first opened and removed from the DOM when collapsed.
      </div>
    </Collapsible.Content>
  </Collapsible.Root>
)

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Collapsible } from '@ark-ui/vue/collapsible'
import { ChevronRightIcon } from 'lucide-vue-next'
import styles from 'styles/collapsible.module.css'
</script>

<template>
  <Collapsible.Root :class="styles.Root" lazy-mount unmount-on-exit>
    <Collapsible.Trigger :class="styles.Trigger">
      Session Details
      <Collapsible.Indicator :class="styles.Indicator">
        <ChevronRightIcon />
      </Collapsible.Indicator>
    </Collapsible.Trigger>
    <Collapsible.Content :class="styles.Content">
      <div :class="styles.Body">
        This content is lazily mounted when first opened and removed from the DOM when collapsed.
      </div>
    </Collapsible.Content>
  </Collapsible.Root>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Collapsible } from '@ark-ui/svelte/collapsible'
  import { ChevronRightIcon } from 'lucide-svelte'
  import styles from 'styles/collapsible.module.css'
</script>

<Collapsible.Root class={styles.Root} lazyMount unmountOnExit>
  <Collapsible.Trigger class={styles.Trigger}>
    Session Details
    <Collapsible.Indicator class={styles.Indicator}>
      <ChevronRightIcon />
    </Collapsible.Indicator>
  </Collapsible.Trigger>
  <Collapsible.Content class={styles.Content}>
    <div class={styles.Body}>
      This content is lazily mounted when first opened and removed from the DOM when collapsed.
    </div>
  </Collapsible.Content>
</Collapsible.Root>

```

### Root Provider

An alternative way to control the collapsible is to use the `RootProvider` component and the `useCollapsible` hook. This
way you can access the state and methods from outside the component.

**Example: root-provider**

#### React

```tsx
import { Collapsible, useCollapsible } from '@ark-ui/react/collapsible'
import { ChevronRightIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import styles from 'styles/collapsible.module.css'

export const RootProvider = () => {
  const collapsible = useCollapsible()

  return (
    <div className="stack">
      <output>
        collapsible: {String(collapsible.open)}, visible: {String(collapsible.visible)}
      </output>
      <Collapsible.RootProvider className={styles.Root} value={collapsible}>
        <Collapsible.Trigger className={styles.Trigger}>
          Toggle Panel
          <Collapsible.Indicator className={styles.Indicator}>
            <ChevronRightIcon />
          </Collapsible.Indicator>
        </Collapsible.Trigger>
        <Collapsible.Content className={styles.Content}>

## Guides

### Indicator Animation

To rotate the indicator icon (such as a chevron) when the collapsible opens and closes, use CSS transforms with the
`data-state` attribute:

```css
[data-scope='collapsible'][data-part='indicator'] {
  transition: transform 200ms;

  &[data-state='open'] {
    transform: rotate(180deg);
  }
}
```

### Open vs Visible

When using `useCollapsible` or `useCollapsibleContext`, you can access the `open` and `visible` state properties. They
seem similar but serve different purposes:

- **`open`**: Indicates the intended state of the collapsible. This is `true` when the collapsible should be expanded
  and `false` when it should be collapsed. This changes immediately when triggered.

- **`visible`**: Indicates whether the content is currently visible in the DOM. This accounts for exit animations - the
  content remains `visible` while the closing animation plays, even though `open` is already `false`. Once the animation
  completes, `visible` becomes `false`.

### Content Animation

Use the `--height` and/or `--width` CSS variables to animate the size of the content when it expands or closes.

If you use `collapsedHeight` or `collapsedWidth`, update your CSS animations to use the `--collapsed-height` or
`--collapsed-width` variables as the starting/ending point:

```css
@keyframes expand {
  from {
    height: var(--collapsed-height, 0);
  }
  to {
    height: var(--height);
  }
}

@keyframes collapse {
  from {
    height: var(--height);
  }
  to {
    height: var(--collapsed-height, 0);
  }
}

[data-scope='collapsible'][data-part='content'] {
  &[data-state='open'] {
    animation: expand 250ms;
  }
  &[data-state='closed'] {
    animation: collapse 250ms;
  }
}
```

### Controlled

Use the `value` and `onValueChange` props to programatically control the color picker's state.

**Example: controlled**

#### React

```tsx
import { ColorPicker, parseColor } from '@ark-ui/react/color-picker'
import { PipetteIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import { useState } from 'react'

export const Controlled = () => {
  const [color, setColor] = useState(() => parseColor('hsl(20, 100%, 50%)'))

  return (
    <div className="stack">
      <output>Selected color: {color.toString('hex')}</output>

      <ColorPicker.Root className={styles.Root} value={color} onValueChange={(e) => setColor(e.value)}>

### Root Provider

An alternative way to control the color picker is to use the `RootProvider` component and the `useColorPicker` hook.
This way you can access the state and methods from outside the component.

**Example: root-provider**

#### React

```tsx
import { ColorPicker, parseColor, useColorPicker } from '@ark-ui/react/color-picker'

export const RootProvider = () => {
  const colorPicker = useColorPicker({ defaultValue: parseColor('#eb5e41') })

  return (
    <div className="stack">
      <output>Color: {colorPicker.valueAsString}</output>

export const Disabled = () => {
  return (
    <ColorPicker.Root className={styles.Root} disabled defaultValue={parseColor('#eb5e41')}>
      <ColorPicker.Label className={styles.Label}>Color</ColorPicker.Label>
      <ColorPicker.Control className={styles.Control}>
        <ColorPicker.ChannelInput className={styles.Input} channel="hex" />

### Swatch Only

A simple color picker with only preset color swatches.

**Example: swatch-only**

#### React

```tsx
import { ColorPicker, parseColor } from '@ark-ui/react/color-picker'
import { CheckIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import styles from 'styles/color-picker.module.css'

const swatches = ['red', 'pink', 'orange', 'purple']

export const SwatchOnly = () => {
  return (
    <ColorPicker.Root className={styles.Root} inline defaultValue={parseColor('#eb5e41')}>
      <output>
        Selected color: <ColorPicker.ValueText className={styles.ValueText} />
      </output>
      <ColorPicker.SwatchGroup className={styles.SwatchGroup}>
        {swatches.map((color) => (
          <ColorPicker.SwatchTrigger key={color} className={styles.SwatchTrigger} value={color}>
            <ColorPicker.Swatch className={styles.Swatch} value={color}>
              <ColorPicker.SwatchIndicator className={styles.SwatchIndicator}>
                <CheckIcon />
              </ColorPicker.SwatchIndicator>
            </ColorPicker.Swatch>
          </ColorPicker.SwatchTrigger>
        ))}
      </ColorPicker.SwatchGroup>
    </ColorPicker.Root>
  )
}

```

        </ColorPicker.ChannelSlider>
      </div>
    </div>
  </ColorPicker.Root>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { ColorPicker, parseColor } from '@ark-ui/svelte/color-picker'
  import styles from 'styles/color-picker.module.css'
</script>

<ColorPicker.Root class={styles.Root} inline defaultValue={parseColor('#eb5e41')}>
  <ColorPicker.Area class={styles.Area}>
    <ColorPicker.AreaBackground class={styles.AreaBackground} />
    <ColorPicker.AreaThumb class={styles.AreaThumb} />
  </ColorPicker.Area>
  <div class={styles.SliderGroup}>
    <div class={styles.Swatch}>
      <ColorPicker.TransparencyGrid class={styles.TransparencyGrid} />
      <ColorPicker.ValueSwatch class={styles.ValueSwatch} />
    </div>
    <div class={styles.ChannelSliders}>
      <ColorPicker.ChannelSlider class={styles.ChannelSlider} channel="hue">
        <ColorPicker.ChannelSliderTrack class={styles.ChannelSliderTrack} />
        <ColorPicker.ChannelSliderThumb class={styles.ChannelSliderThumb} />
      </ColorPicker.ChannelSlider>
      <ColorPicker.ChannelSlider class={styles.ChannelSlider} channel="alpha">

        <ColorPicker.ChannelSliderTrack class={styles.ChannelSliderTrack} />
        <ColorPicker.ChannelSliderThumb class={styles.ChannelSliderThumb} />
      </ColorPicker.ChannelSlider>
    </div>
  </div>
</ColorPicker.Root>

```

### Field

The `Field` component helps manage form-related state and accessibility attributes of a color picker. It includes
handling ARIA labels, helper text, and error text to ensure proper accessibility.

**Example: with-field**

#### React

```tsx
import { ColorPicker, parseColor } from '@ark-ui/react/color-picker'
import { Field } from '@ark-ui/react/field'
import field from 'styles/field.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/color-picker.module.css'

export const WithField = () => (
  <Field.Root className={field.Root}>
    <ColorPicker.Root className={styles.Root} defaultValue={parseColor('#eb5e41')}>
      <ColorPicker.Label className={styles.Label}>Label</ColorPicker.Label>
      <ColorPicker.Control className={styles.Control}>
        <ColorPicker.ChannelInput className={styles.Input} channel="hex" />
        <ColorPicker.ChannelInput className={styles.ChannelInput} channel="alpha" />
        <ColorPicker.Trigger className={styles.Trigger}>
          <div className={styles.Swatch}>
            <ColorPicker.TransparencyGrid className={styles.TransparencyGrid} />
            <ColorPicker.ValueSwatch className={styles.ValueSwatch} />
          </div>
        </ColorPicker.Trigger>
      </ColorPicker.Control>
      <ColorPicker.Positioner>
        <ColorPicker.Content className={styles.Content} />
      </ColorPicker.Positioner>
      <ColorPicker.HiddenInput />
    </ColorPicker.Root>
    <Field.HelperText className={field.HelperText}>Additional Info</Field.HelperText>
    <Field.ErrorText className={field.ErrorText}>Error Info</Field.ErrorText>
  </Field.Root>
)

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { ColorPicker, parseColor } from '@ark-ui/solid/color-picker'
import { Field } from '@ark-ui/solid/field'
import field from 'styles/field.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/color-picker.module.css'

export const WithField = () => (
  <Field.Root class={field.Root}>
    <ColorPicker.Root class={styles.Root} defaultValue={parseColor('#eb5e41')}>
      <ColorPicker.Label class={styles.Label}>Label</ColorPicker.Label>
      <ColorPicker.Control class={styles.Control}>
        <ColorPicker.ChannelInput class={styles.Input} channel="hex" />
        <ColorPicker.ChannelInput class={styles.ChannelInput} channel="alpha" />
        <ColorPicker.Trigger class={styles.Trigger}>
          <div class={styles.Swatch}>
            <ColorPicker.TransparencyGrid class={styles.TransparencyGrid} />
            <ColorPicker.ValueSwatch class={styles.ValueSwatch} />
          </div>
        </ColorPicker.Trigger>
      </ColorPicker.Control>
      <ColorPicker.Positioner>
        <ColorPicker.Content class={styles.Content} />
      </ColorPicker.Positioner>
      <ColorPicker.HiddenInput />
    </ColorPicker.Root>
    <Field.HelperText class={field.HelperText}>Additional Info</Field.HelperText>
    <Field.ErrorText class={field.ErrorText}>Error Info</Field.ErrorText>
  </Field.Root>
)

```

```

### Form Usage

Integrate the color picker with form libraries like React Hook Form using the `HiddenInput` component.

**Example: form-usage**

#### React

```tsx
import { ColorPicker, parseColor } from '@ark-ui/react/color-picker'
import { PipetteIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import { useForm } from 'react-hook-form'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/color-picker.module.css'

interface FieldValues {
  color: string
}

export const FormUsage = () => {
  const { register, handleSubmit } = useForm<FieldValues>()

  const onSubmit = (data: FieldValues) => {
    alert(data)
  }

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit(onSubmit)}>
      <ColorPicker.Root className={styles.Root} inline defaultValue={parseColor('#eb5e41')}>
        <ColorPicker.HiddenInput {...register('color')} />

        <ColorPicker.Area className={styles.Area}>
          <ColorPicker.AreaBackground className={styles.AreaBackground} />
          <ColorPicker.AreaThumb className={styles.AreaThumb} />
        </ColorPicker.Area>
        <div className={styles.SliderGroup}>
          <ColorPicker.EyeDropperTrigger className={styles.EyeDropperTrigger}>
            <PipetteIcon />
          </ColorPicker.EyeDropperTrigger>
          <div className={styles.ChannelSliders}>
            <ColorPicker.ChannelSlider className={styles.ChannelSlider} channel="hue">
              <ColorPicker.ChannelSliderTrack className={styles.ChannelSliderTrack} />
              <ColorPicker.ChannelSliderThumb className={styles.ChannelSliderThumb} />

              <ColorPicker.ChannelSliderThumb className={styles.ChannelSliderThumb} />
            </ColorPicker.ChannelSlider>

            <ColorPicker.ChannelInput className={styles.ChannelInput} channel="hex" />
            <ColorPicker.ChannelInput className={styles.ChannelInput} channel="alpha" />
          </div>
        </ColorPicker.View>

        <ColorPicker.View className={styles.View} format="hsla">
          <div className={styles.ChannelInputGroup}>
            <ColorPicker.ChannelInput className={styles.ChannelInput} channel="hue" />
            <ColorPicker.ChannelInput className={styles.ChannelInput} channel="saturation" />
            <ColorPicker.ChannelInput className={styles.ChannelInput} channel="lightness" />
          </div>
        </ColorPicker.View>

        <button className={button.Root} type="submit" data-variant="solid">

### Grouping

To group related combobox items, use the `groupBy` prop on the collection and `collection.group()` to iterate the
groups.

**Example: grouping**

### Field

The `Field` component helps manage form-related state and accessibility attributes of a combobox. It includes handling
ARIA labels, helper text, and error text to ensure proper accessibility.

**Example: with-field**

#### React

```tsx
import { Combobox, useListCollection } from '@ark-ui/react/combobox'
import { Field } from '@ark-ui/react/field'
import { useFilter } from '@ark-ui/react/locale'
import { CheckIcon, ChevronsUpDownIcon, XIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import styles from 'styles/combobox.module.css'
import field from 'styles/field.module.css'

export const WithField = () => {
  const { contains } = useFilter({ sensitivity: 'base' })

  const { collection, filter } = useListCollection({
    initialItems,
    filter: contains,
  })

  const handleInputChange = (details: Combobox.InputValueChangeDetails) => {
    filter(details.inputValue)
  }

  return (
    <Field.Root className={field.Root}>
      <Combobox.Root className={styles.Root} collection={collection} onInputValueChange={handleInputChange}>
        <Combobox.Label className={styles.Label}>Department</Combobox.Label>
        <Combobox.Control className={styles.Control}>
          <Combobox.Input className={styles.Input} placeholder="e.g. Engineering" />
          <div className={styles.Indicators}>
            <Combobox.ClearTrigger className={styles.ClearTrigger}>
              <XIcon />
            </Combobox.ClearTrigger>
            <Combobox.Trigger className={styles.Trigger}>

        </Combobox.Control>
        <Combobox.Positioner>
          <Combobox.Content className={styles.Content}>

      <Field.ErrorText className={field.ErrorText}>Department is required</Field.ErrorText>
    </Field.Root>
  )
}

const initialItems = [
  { label: 'Engineering', value: 'engineering' },
  { label: 'Design', value: 'design' },
  { label: 'Marketing', value: 'marketing' },
  { label: 'Sales', value: 'sales' },

### Context

Use the `Combobox.Context` component to access the combobox state and display information like the selected value.

**Example: context**

#### React

```tsx
import { Combobox, useListCollection } from '@ark-ui/react/combobox'
import { useFilter } from '@ark-ui/react/locale'
import { Portal } from '@ark-ui/react/portal'
import { CheckIcon, ChevronsUpDownIcon, XIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import styles from 'styles/combobox.module.css'

export const Context = () => {
  const { contains } = useFilter({ sensitivity: 'base' })

  const { collection, filter } = useListCollection({
    initialItems: [
      { label: 'Small', value: 'sm' },
      { label: 'Medium', value: 'md' },
      { label: 'Large', value: 'lg' },
      { label: 'Extra Large', value: 'xl' },
    ],

### Root Provider

An alternative way to control the combobox is to use the `RootProvider` component and the `useCombobox` hook. This way
you can access the state and methods from outside the component.

**Example: root-provider**

#### React

```tsx
import { Combobox, useCombobox, useListCollection } from '@ark-ui/react/combobox'

  { label: 'Product Manager', value: 'pm' },
  { label: 'Data Scientist', value: 'data-scientist' },
  { label: 'DevOps Engineer', value: 'devops' },
  { label: 'Marketing Lead', value: 'marketing' },
]

export const RootProvider = () => {
  const { contains } = useFilter({ sensitivity: 'base' })

  const { collection, filter } = useListCollection({
    initialItems,
    filter: contains,
  })

  const combobox = useCombobox({
    collection,
    onInputValueChange(details) {
      filter(details.inputValue)
    },
  })

  return (

### Rehydrate

When a combobox has a `defaultValue` or `value` but the `collection` is not loaded yet, you can rehydrate the value to
populate the input.

**Example: rehydrate-value**

#### React

```tsx
import { Combobox, useCombobox, useComboboxContext, useListCollection } from '@ark-ui/react/combobox'
import { Portal } from '@ark-ui/react/portal'
import { CheckIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import { useRef, useState } from 'react'
import { useAsync } from 'react-use'
import styles from 'styles/combobox.module.css'

function ComboboxRehydrateValue() {
  const combobox = useComboboxContext()
  const hydrated = useRef(false)
  if (combobox.value.length && combobox.collection.size && !hydrated.current) {
    combobox.syncSelectedItems()
    hydrated.current = true
  }
  return null
}

export const RehydrateValue = () => {
  const [inputValue, setInputValue] = useState('')

  const { collection, set } = useListCollection<Character>({
    initialItems: [],
    itemToString: (item) => item.name,
    itemToValue: (item) => item.name,
  })

  const combobox = useCombobox({
    collection,
    defaultValue: ['C-3PO'],
    placeholder: 'Example: Dexter',
    inputValue,
    onInputValueChange: (e) => setInputValue(e.inputValue),
  })

  const state = useAsync(async () => {
    const response = await fetch(`https://swapi.py4e.com/api/people/?search=${inputValue}`)
    const data = await response.json()
    set(data.results)
  }, [inputValue, set])

  return (
    <Combobox.RootProvider className={styles.Root} value={combobox}>
      <Combobox.Label className={styles.Label}>Search Star Wars Characters</Combobox.Label>

                    {item.name} - {item.height}cm / {item.mass}kg
                  </Combobox.ItemText>
                  <Combobox.ItemIndicator className={styles.ItemIndicator}>
                    <CheckIcon />
                  </Combobox.ItemIndicator>
                </Combobox.Item>

### Dynamic

Generate combobox items dynamically based on user input. This is useful for creating suggestions or autocomplete
functionality.

**Example: dynamic**

#### React

```tsx
import { Combobox, useListCollection } from '@ark-ui/react/combobox'
import { Portal } from '@ark-ui/react/portal'
import { CheckIcon, ChevronsUpDownIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import styles from 'styles/combobox.module.css'

const suggestList = ['gmail.com', 'yahoo.com', 'ark-ui.com']

export const Dynamic = () => {
  const { collection, set } = useListCollection<string>({
    initialItems: [],
  })

  const handleInputChange = (details: Combobox.InputValueChangeDetails) => {
    if (details.reason === 'input-change') {
      const items = suggestList.map((item) => `${details.inputValue}@${item}`)
      set(items)
    }
  }

  return (
    <Combobox.Root className={styles.Root} collection={collection} onInputValueChange={handleInputChange}>
      <Combobox.Label className={styles.Label}>Email</Combobox.Label>
      <Combobox.Control className={styles.Control}>
        <Combobox.Input className={styles.Input} placeholder="e.g. john" />
        <div className={styles.Indicators}>
          <Combobox.Trigger className={styles.Trigger}>
            <ChevronsUpDownIcon />
          </Combobox.Trigger>
        </div>
      </Combobox.Control>
      <Portal>
        <Combobox.Positioner>
          <Combobox.Content className={styles.Content}>
            {collection.items.map((item) => (
              <Combobox.Item className={styles.Item} key={item} item={item}>
                <Combobox.ItemText className={styles.ItemText}>{item}</Combobox.ItemText>
                <Combobox.ItemIndicator className={styles.ItemIndicator}>
                  <CheckIcon />
                </Combobox.ItemIndicator>
              </Combobox.Item>

### Creatable

Allow users to create new options when their search doesn't match any existing items. This is useful for tags,
categories, or other custom values.

**Example: creatable**

### Multiple Selection

Enable multiple selection by setting the `multiple` prop. Selected items can be displayed as tags above the input.

**Example: multiple**

#### React

```tsx

### Async Search

Load options asynchronously based on user input using the `useAsyncList` hook. This is useful for searching large
datasets or fetching data from an API.

**Example: async-search**

#### React

```tsx
import { useAsyncList } from '@ark-ui/react/collection'
import { Combobox, createListCollection } from '@ark-ui/react/combobox'
import { Portal } from '@ark-ui/react/portal'
import { CheckIcon, ChevronsUpDownIcon, LoaderIcon, XIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import { startTransition } from 'react'
import styles from 'styles/combobox.module.css'

interface Movie {
  id: string
  title: string
  year: number
  director: string
  genre: string
}

export const AsyncSearch = () => {
  const list = useAsyncList<Movie>({
    async load({ filterText, signal }) {
      if (!filterText) return { items: [] }

      await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 300))

      if (signal?.aborted) return { items: [] }

      const items = allMovies.filter(
        (movie) =>
          movie.title.toLowerCase().includes(filterText.toLowerCase()) ||
          movie.director.toLowerCase().includes(filterText.toLowerCase()) ||
          movie.genre.toLowerCase().includes(filterText.toLowerCase()),
      )

      return { items }
    },
  })

  const collection = createListCollection({
    items: list.items,
    itemToString: (item) => item.title,

### Virtualized

For very large lists, use virtualization with `@tanstack/virtual` to render only the visible items. Pass the
`scrollToIndexFn` prop to enable keyboard navigation within the virtualized list.

**Example: virtualized**

#### React

```tsx
import { Combobox, useListCollection } from '@ark-ui/react/combobox'
import { useFilter } from '@ark-ui/react/locale'
import { Portal } from '@ark-ui/react/portal'
import { useVirtualizer } from '@tanstack/react-virtual'
import { CheckIcon, ChevronsUpDownIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import { useRef } from 'react'
import { flushSync } from 'react-dom'
import styles from 'styles/combobox.module.css'

export const Virtualized = () => {
  const contentRef = useRef<HTMLDivElement | null>(null)

  const { startsWith } = useFilter({ sensitivity: 'base' })

  const { collection, filter, reset } = useListCollection({
    initialItems: countries,
    filter: startsWith,
  })

  const virtualizer = useVirtualizer({
    count: collection.size,
    getScrollElement: () => contentRef.current,
    estimateSize: () => 32,
    overscan: 10,
  })

  const handleScrollToIndex: Combobox.RootProps<Country>['scrollToIndexFn'] = (details) => {
    flushSync(() => {
      virtualizer.scrollToIndex(details.index, {
        align: 'center',
        behavior: 'auto',
      })
    })
  }

  const handleInputChange = (details: Combobox.InputValueChangeDetails) => {
    filter(details.inputValue)

      { country: 'Canada', code: 'CA', flag: '🇨🇦' },
      { country: 'Australia', code: 'AU', flag: '🇦🇺' },
    ],
    itemToString: (item) => item.country,
    itemToValue: (item) => item.code,
    filter: contains,
  })

  const handleInputChange = (details: Combobox.InputValueChangeDetails) => {

## Guides

### Router Links

Customize the `navigate` prop on `Combobox.Root` to integrate with your router. Using Tanstack Router:

```tsx
import { Combobox } from '@ark-ui/<framework>/combobox'
import { useNavigate } from '@tanstack/react-router'

function Demo() {
  const navigate = useNavigate()
  return (
    <Combobox.Root
      navigate={(e) => {
        navigate({ to: e.node.href })
      }}
    >
      {/* ... */}
    </Combobox.Root>
  )
}
```

### Custom Objects

By default, the combobox collection expects an array of objects with `label` and `value` properties. In some cases, you
may need to deal with custom objects.

Use the `itemToString` and `itemToValue` props to map the custom object to the required interface.

```tsx
const items = [
  { country: 'United States', code: 'US', flag: '🇺🇸' },
  { country: 'Canada', code: 'CA', flag: '🇨🇦' },
  { country: 'Australia', code: 'AU', flag: '🇦🇺' },
  // ...
]

const { collection } = useListCollection({
  initialItems: items,
  itemToString: (item) => item.country,
  itemToValue: (item) => item.code,
})
```

### Type Safety

The `Combobox.RootComponent` type enables you to create typed wrapper components that maintain full type safety for
collection items.

```tsx
const Combobox: ArkCombobox.RootComponent = (props) => {
  return <ArkCombobox.Root {...props}>{/* ... */}</ArkCombobox.Root>
}
```

Use the wrapper with full type inference on `onValueChange` and other callbacks:

```tsx
const App = () => {
  const { collection } = useListCollection({
    initialItems: [
      { label: 'React', value: 'react' },
      { label: 'Vue', value: 'vue' },
    ],
  })
  return (
    <Combobox
      collection={collection}
      onValueChange={(e) => {
        // e.items is typed as Array<{ label: string, value: string }>
        console.log(e.items)
      }}
    >
      {/* ... */}
    </Combobox>
  )
}
```

### Large Datasets

The recommended way of managing large lists is to use the `limit` property on the `useListCollection` hook. This will
limit the number of rendered items in the DOM to improve performance.

```tsx {3}
const { collection } = useListCollection({
  initialItems: items,
  limit: 10,
})
```

### Available Size

The following css variables are exposed to the `Combobox.Positioner` which you can use to style the `Combobox.Content`

```css
/* width of the combobox control */
--reference-width: <pixel-value>;
/* width of the available viewport */
--available-width: <pixel-value>;
/* height of the available viewport */
--available-height: <pixel-value>;
```

For example, if you want to make sure the maximum height doesn't exceed the available height, you can use the following:

```css
[data-scope='combobox'][data-part='content'] {
  max-height: calc(var(--available-height) - 100px);
}
```

### Default Value

Use the `defaultValue` prop with `parseDate` to set the initial date value.

**Example: default-value**

#### React

```tsx
import { DatePicker, parseDate } from '@ark-ui/react/date-picker'
import { Portal } from '@ark-ui/react/portal'
import { CalendarIcon, ChevronLeftIcon, ChevronRightIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/date-picker.module.css'

export const DefaultValue = () => {
  return (
    <DatePicker.Root className={styles.Root} defaultValue={[parseDate('2025-01-15')]}>
      <DatePicker.Label className={styles.Label}>Label</DatePicker.Label>

### Controlled

Use the `value` and `onValueChange` props to control the date picker's value programmatically.

**Example: controlled**

### Root Provider

An alternative way to control the date picker is to use the `RootProvider` component and the `useDatePicker` hook. This
way you can access the state and methods from outside the component.

**Example: root-provider**

#### React

```tsx

### Month and Year Select

Use `MonthSelect` and `YearSelect` components to create a header with dropdown selects for quick month/year navigation,
alongside the prev/next triggers.

**Example: month-year-select**

### Range

To create a date picker that allows a range selection, you need to:

- Set the `selectionMode` prop to `range`.
- Render multiple inputs with the `index` prop set to `0` and `1`.

**Example: range-selection**

#### React

```tsx

### Multiple

Use the `selectionMode="multiple"` prop to allow selecting multiple dates. This example also shows how to display
selected dates as removable tags.

**Example: multi-selection**

#### React

```tsx
import { DatePicker } from '@ark-ui/react/date-picker'

import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/date-picker.module.css'

const formatWithDay = (date: DateValue) => {
  const jsDate = date.toDate('UTC')
  return jsDate.toLocaleDateString('en-US', {
    weekday: 'short',
    month: 'short',
    day: 'numeric',
  })
}

export const MultiSelection = () => {
  return (
    <DatePicker.Root className={styles.Root} selectionMode="multiple">
      <DatePicker.Label className={styles.Label}>Label</DatePicker.Label>
      <DatePicker.Control className={styles.Control}>

              ) : (
                datePicker.value.map((date, index) => (

### Multiple Months

To create a date picker that displays multiple months side by side:

- Set the `numOfMonths` prop to the number of months you want to display.
- Use the `datePicker.getOffset({ months: 1 })` to get data for the next month.

**Example: multiple-months**

### Min and Max

Use the `min` and `max` props with `parseDate` to restrict the selectable date range. Dates outside this range will be
disabled.

**Example: min-max**

#### React

```tsx

import styles from 'styles/date-picker.module.css'

export const MinMax = () => {
  return (
    <DatePicker.Root className={styles.Root} min={parseDate('2025-03-05')} max={parseDate('2025-03-31')}>

### Unavailable

Use the `isDateUnavailable` prop to mark specific dates as unavailable. This example disables weekends.

**Example: unavailable**

import styles from 'styles/date-picker.module.css'

const isWeekend = (date: DateValue) => {
  const dayOfWeek = date.toDate('UTC').getDay()
  return dayOfWeek === 0 || dayOfWeek === 6

### Locale

Use the `locale` prop to set the language and formatting, and `startOfWeek` to set the first day of the week (0 =
Sunday, 1 = Monday, etc.).

**Example: locale**

### Month Picker

Create a month-only picker by setting `defaultView="month"` and `minView="month"`. Use custom `format` and `parse`
functions to handle month/year input format.

**Example: month-picker**

#### React

```tsx
import { DatePicker } from '@ark-ui/react/date-picker'
import { Portal } from '@ark-ui/react/portal'
import { CalendarDate, type DateValue } from '@internationalized/date'
import { CalendarIcon, ChevronLeftIcon, ChevronRightIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/date-picker.module.css'

const format = (date: DateValue) => {
  const month = date.month.toString().padStart(2, '0')
  const year = date.year.toString()
  return `${month}/${year}`
}

const parse = (string: string) => {
  const fullRegex = /^(\d{1,2})\/(\d{4})$/
  const fullMatch = string.match(fullRegex)
  if (fullMatch) {
    const [_, month, year] = fullMatch.map(Number)
    return new CalendarDate(year, month, 1)
  }
}

export const MonthPicker = () => {
  return (
    <DatePicker.Root
      className={styles.Root}
      format={format}
      parse={parse}
      defaultView="month"
      minView="month"
      placeholder="mm/yyyy"
    >
      <DatePicker.Label className={styles.Label}>Label</DatePicker.Label>
      <DatePicker.Control className={styles.Control}>
        <DatePicker.Input className={styles.Input} />
        <DatePicker.Trigger className={styles.Trigger}>
          <CalendarIcon />
        </DatePicker.Trigger>

        <DatePicker.Positioner>

### Year Picker

Create a year-only picker by setting `defaultView="year"` and `minView="year"`. Use custom `format` and `parse`
functions to handle year-only input format.

**Example: year-picker**

#### React

```tsx
import { DatePicker, parseDate } from '@ark-ui/react/date-picker'
import { Portal } from '@ark-ui/react/portal'
import type { DateValue } from '@internationalized/date'
import { CalendarIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/date-picker.module.css'

const format = (date: DateValue) => date.year.toString()

const parse = (string: string | undefined) => {
  if (string === '' || !string) return
  const year = Number(string)
  if (year < 100) {
    const currentYear = new Date().getFullYear()
    const currentCentury = Math.floor(currentYear / 100) * 100
    return parseDate(new Date(currentCentury + year, 0))
  }
  return parseDate(new Date(Number(string), 0))
}

export const YearPicker = () => {

```

### Inline

Use the `inline` prop to display the date picker directly on the page, without a popup.

> When using the `inline` prop, omit the `Portal`, `Positioner`, and `Content` components to render the calendar inline
> within your layout.

**Example: inline**

                    <DatePicker.TableCellTrigger class={styles.YearTableCellTrigger}>{year.label}</DatePicker.TableCellTrigger>
                  </DatePicker.TableCell>
                {/each}
              </DatePicker.TableRow>
            {/each}
          </DatePicker.TableBody>
        </DatePicker.Table>
      {/snippet}
    </DatePicker.Context>
  </DatePicker.View>
</DatePicker.Root>

```

### Custom Parsing

Use the `parse` prop to implement custom date parsing logic. This allows users to enter dates in flexible formats like
"25/12" or "25/12/24" which are automatically converted to valid dates.

**Example: format-parse**

#### React

```tsx
import { DatePicker } from '@ark-ui/react/date-picker'
import { Portal } from '@ark-ui/react/portal'
import { CalendarDate, type DateValue } from '@internationalized/date'
import { CalendarIcon, ChevronLeftIcon, ChevronRightIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/date-picker.module.css'

const parse = (value: string) => {
  const fullRegex = /^(\d{1,2})\/(\d{1,2})\/(\d{2})$/
  const fullMatch = value.match(fullRegex)
  if (fullMatch) {
    const [_, day, month, year] = fullMatch.map(Number)
    try {
      return new CalendarDate(year + 2000, month, day)
    } catch {
      return undefined
    }
  }

  const partialRegex = /^(\d{1,2})\/(\d{1,2})$/
  const partialMatch = value.match(partialRegex)
  if (partialMatch) {
    const [_, day, month] = partialMatch.map(Number)
    const currentYear = new Date().getFullYear()
    try {
      return new CalendarDate(currentYear, month, day)
    } catch {
      return undefined
    }
  }

  const dayRegex = /^(\d{1,2})$/
  const dayMatch = value.match(dayRegex)
  if (dayMatch) {
    const [_, day] = dayMatch.map(Number)
    const currentYear = new Date().getFullYear()
    return new CalendarDate(currentYear, 1, day)
  }

  return undefined
}

const format = (date: DateValue) => {
  const day = date.day.toString().padStart(2, '0')
  const month = date.month.toString().padStart(2, '0')
  const year = (date.year % 100).toString().padStart(2, '0')
  return `${day}/${month}/${year}`
}

### Month Picker Range

Create a month range picker by combining `selectionMode="range"` with `defaultView="month"` and `minView="month"`. This
is useful for selecting billing periods or date ranges by month.

**Example: month-picker-range**

#### React

```tsx
import { DatePicker } from '@ark-ui/react/date-picker'
import { Portal } from '@ark-ui/react/portal'
import { CalendarDate, type DateValue } from '@internationalized/date'
import { CalendarIcon, ChevronLeftIcon, ChevronRightIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/date-picker.module.css'

const format = (date: DateValue) => {
  const month = date.month.toString().padStart(2, '0')
  const year = date.year.toString()
  return `${month}/${year}`
}

const parse = (string: string) => {
  const fullRegex = /^(\d{1,2})\/(\d{4})$/
  const fullMatch = string.match(fullRegex)
  if (fullMatch) {
    const [_, month, year] = fullMatch.map(Number)
    return new CalendarDate(year, month, 1)
  }
}

export const MonthPickerRange = () => {
  return (
    <DatePicker.Root
      className={styles.Root}
      selectionMode="range"
      defaultView="month"
      minView="month"
      format={format}
      parse={parse}
      placeholder="mm/yyyy"
    >
      <DatePicker.Label className={styles.Label}>Label</DatePicker.Label>

### Year Range

Create a year range picker by combining `selectionMode="range"` with `defaultView="year"` and `minView="year"`. This is
useful for selecting multi-year periods.

**Example: year-picker-range**

#### React

```tsx
import { DatePicker } from '@ark-ui/react/date-picker'

import { CalendarDate, type DateValue } from '@internationalized/date'
import { CalendarIcon, ChevronLeftIcon, ChevronRightIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/date-picker.module.css'

const format = (date: DateValue) => date.year.toString()

const parse = (string: string) => {
  const fullRegex = /^(\d{4})$/
  const fullMatch = string.match(fullRegex)
  if (fullMatch) {
    const [_, year] = fullMatch.map(Number)
    return new CalendarDate(year, 1, 1)
  }
}

export const YearPickerRange = () => {
  return (
    <DatePicker.Root

### With Time

Integrate a time input with the date picker using `CalendarDateTime` from `@internationalized/date`. The time input
updates the hour and minute of the selected date value.

**Example: with-time**

#### React

```tsx
import { CalendarDateTime, DateFormatter, getLocalTimeZone } from '@internationalized/date'
import { DatePicker, type DatePickerValueChangeDetails } from '@ark-ui/react/date-picker'
import { Portal } from '@ark-ui/react/portal'
import { CalendarIcon, ChevronLeftIcon, ChevronRightIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import { useState } from 'react'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/date-picker.module.css'

const formatter = new DateFormatter('en-US', {
  month: 'short',
  day: 'numeric',
  year: 'numeric',
  hour: 'numeric',
  minute: '2-digit',
})

export const WithTime = () => {
  const [value, setValue] = useState<CalendarDateTime[]>([new CalendarDateTime(2025, 1, 29, 14, 30)])

  const timeValue = value[0]
    ? `${String(value[0].hour).padStart(2, '0')}:${String(value[0].minute).padStart(2, '0')}`
    : ''

  const onTimeChange = (e: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
    const [hours, minutes] = e.currentTarget.value.split(':').map(Number)
    setValue((prev) => {
      const current = prev[0] ?? new CalendarDateTime(2025, 1, 1, 0, 0)
      return [current.set({ hour: hours, minute: minutes })]
    })
  }

  const onDateChange = (details: DatePickerValueChangeDetails) => {
    const newDate = details.value[0]
    if (!newDate) return setValue([])
    const prevTime = value[0] ?? { hour: 0, minute: 0 }
    setValue([new CalendarDateTime(newDate.year, newDate.month, newDate.day, prevTime.hour, prevTime.minute)])
  }

  return (

### Controlled

Manage the dialog state using the `open` and `onOpenChange` props.

**Example: controlled**

#### React

```tsx
import { Dialog } from '@ark-ui/react/dialog'
import { Portal } from '@ark-ui/react/portal'
import { XIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import { useState } from 'react'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/dialog.module.css'

export const Controlled = () => {
  const [open, setOpen] = useState(false)
  return (
    <Dialog.Root open={open} onOpenChange={(e) => setOpen(e.open)}>
      <Dialog.Trigger className={button.Root}>Open Dialog</Dialog.Trigger>
      <Portal>
        <Dialog.Backdrop className={styles.Backdrop} />
        <Dialog.Positioner className={styles.Positioner}>
          <Dialog.Content className={styles.Content}>
            <Dialog.CloseTrigger className={styles.CloseTrigger}>
              <XIcon />
            </Dialog.CloseTrigger>
            <Dialog.Title className={styles.Title}>Session Settings</Dialog.Title>
            <Dialog.Description className={styles.Description}>
              Manage your session preferences and security options.
            </Dialog.Description>
          </Dialog.Content>
        </Dialog.Positioner>
      </Portal>
    </Dialog.Root>
  )
}

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Dialog } from '@ark-ui/solid/dialog'
import { XIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { createSignal } from 'solid-js'
import { Portal } from 'solid-js/web'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/dialog.module.css'

export const Controlled = () => {
  const [open, setOpen] = createSignal(false)

  return (
    <Dialog.Root open={open()} onOpenChange={(e) => setOpen(e.open)}>
      <Dialog.Trigger class={button.Root}>Open Dialog</Dialog.Trigger>
      <Portal>
        <Dialog.Backdrop class={styles.Backdrop} />
        <Dialog.Positioner class={styles.Positioner}>
          <Dialog.Content class={styles.Content}>
            <Dialog.CloseTrigger class={styles.CloseTrigger}>
              <XIcon />
            </Dialog.CloseTrigger>
            <Dialog.Title class={styles.Title}>Session Settings</Dialog.Title>
            <Dialog.Description class={styles.Description}>
              Manage your session preferences and security options.
            </Dialog.Description>
          </Dialog.Content>
        </Dialog.Positioner>
      </Portal>
    </Dialog.Root>
  )
}

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Dialog } from '@ark-ui/vue/dialog'
import { XIcon } from 'lucide-vue-next'
import { ref } from 'vue'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/dialog.module.css'

const open = ref(false)
</script>

<template>
  <button :class="button.Root" @click="() => (open = true)">Toggle</button>
  <Dialog.Root v-model:open="open">
    <Teleport to="body">
      <Dialog.Backdrop :class="styles.Backdrop" />
      <Dialog.Positioner :class="styles.Positioner">
        <Dialog.Content :class="styles.Content">
          <Dialog.CloseTrigger :class="styles.CloseTrigger">
            <XIcon />
          </Dialog.CloseTrigger>
          <Dialog.Title :class="styles.Title">Session Settings</Dialog.Title>
          <Dialog.Description :class="styles.Description">
            Manage your session preferences and security options.
          </Dialog.Description>
        </Dialog.Content>
      </Dialog.Positioner>
    </Teleport>
  </Dialog.Root>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Dialog } from '@ark-ui/svelte/dialog'
  import { Portal } from '@ark-ui/svelte/portal'
  import { XIcon } from 'lucide-svelte'
  import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
  import styles from 'styles/dialog.module.css'

  let open = $state(false)
</script>

<button type="button" class={button.Root} onclick={() => (open = !open)}>Toggle</button>
<Dialog.Root bind:open>
  <Portal>
    <Dialog.Backdrop class={styles.Backdrop} />
    <Dialog.Positioner class={styles.Positioner}>
      <Dialog.Content class={styles.Content}>
        <Dialog.CloseTrigger class={styles.CloseTrigger}>
          <XIcon />
        </Dialog.CloseTrigger>
        <Dialog.Title class={styles.Title}>Session Settings</Dialog.Title>
        <Dialog.Description class={styles.Description}>
          Manage your session preferences and security options.
        </Dialog.Description>
      </Dialog.Content>
    </Dialog.Positioner>
  </Portal>
</Dialog.Root>

```

### Root Provider

An alternative way to control the dialog is to use the `RootProvider` component and the `useDialog` hook. This way you
can access the state and methods from outside the component.

**Example: root-provider**

#### React

```tsx
import { Dialog, useDialog } from '@ark-ui/react/dialog'
import { Portal } from '@ark-ui/react/portal'
import { XIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/dialog.module.css'

export const RootProvider = () => {
  const dialog = useDialog()

  return (
    <div className="stack">
      <button className={button.Root} onClick={() => dialog.setOpen(true)}>
        Dialog is {dialog.open ? 'open' : 'closed'}
      </button>
      <Dialog.RootProvider value={dialog}>
        <Portal>
          <Dialog.Backdrop className={styles.Backdrop} />
          <Dialog.Positioner className={styles.Positioner}>
            <Dialog.Content className={styles.Content}>
              <Dialog.CloseTrigger className={styles.CloseTrigger}>
                <XIcon />
              </Dialog.CloseTrigger>
              <Dialog.Title className={styles.Title}>Controlled Externally</Dialog.Title>
              <Dialog.Description className={styles.Description}>
                This dialog is controlled via the useDialog hook.
              </Dialog.Description>
            </Dialog.Content>
          </Dialog.Positioner>
        </Portal>
      </Dialog.RootProvider>
    </div>
  )
}

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Dialog, useDialog } from '@ark-ui/solid/dialog'
import { XIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { Portal } from 'solid-js/web'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/dialog.module.css'

export const RootProvider = () => {
  const dialog = useDialog()

  return (
    <>
      <button class={button.Root} onClick={() => dialog().setOpen(true)}>
        Open
      </button>

      <Dialog.RootProvider value={dialog}>
        <Portal>
          <Dialog.Backdrop class={styles.Backdrop} />
          <Dialog.Positioner class={styles.Positioner}>
            <Dialog.Content class={styles.Content}>
              <Dialog.CloseTrigger class={styles.CloseTrigger}>
                <XIcon />
              </Dialog.CloseTrigger>
              <Dialog.Title class={styles.Title}>Account Settings</Dialog.Title>
              <Dialog.Description class={styles.Description}>
                Manage your account preferences and security options.
              </Dialog.Description>
            </Dialog.Content>
          </Dialog.Positioner>
        </Portal>
      </Dialog.RootProvider>
    </>
  )
}

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Dialog, useDialog } from '@ark-ui/vue/dialog'
import { XIcon } from 'lucide-vue-next'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/dialog.module.css'

const dialog = useDialog()
</script>

<template>
  <button :class="button.Root" @click="dialog.setOpen(true)">Open</button>

  <Dialog.RootProvider :value="dialog">
    <Teleport to="body">
      <Dialog.Backdrop :class="styles.Backdrop" />
      <Dialog.Positioner :class="styles.Positioner">
        <Dialog.Content :class="styles.Content">
          <Dialog.CloseTrigger :class="styles.CloseTrigger">
            <XIcon />
          </Dialog.CloseTrigger>
          <Dialog.Title :class="styles.Title">Account Settings</Dialog.Title>
          <Dialog.Description :class="styles.Description">
            Manage your account preferences and security options.
          </Dialog.Description>
        </Dialog.Content>
      </Dialog.Positioner>
    </Teleport>
  </Dialog.RootProvider>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Dialog, useDialog } from '@ark-ui/svelte/dialog'
  import { Portal } from '@ark-ui/svelte/portal'
  import { XIcon } from 'lucide-svelte'
  import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
  import styles from 'styles/dialog.module.css'

  const id = $props.id()

  const dialog = useDialog({ id })
</script>

<button class={button.Root} onclick={() => dialog().setOpen(true)}>Open</button>

<Dialog.RootProvider value={dialog}>
  <Portal>
    <Dialog.Backdrop class={styles.Backdrop} />
    <Dialog.Positioner class={styles.Positioner}>
      <Dialog.Content class={styles.Content}>
        <Dialog.CloseTrigger class={styles.CloseTrigger}>
          <XIcon />
        </Dialog.CloseTrigger>
        <Dialog.Title class={styles.Title}>Account Settings</Dialog.Title>
        <Dialog.Description class={styles.Description}>
          Manage your account preferences and security options.
        </Dialog.Description>
      </Dialog.Content>
    </Dialog.Positioner>
  </Portal>
</Dialog.RootProvider>

```

### Alert Dialog

For critical confirmations or destructive actions, use `role="alertdialog"`. Alert dialogs differ from regular dialogs
in important ways:

- **Automatic focus**: The close/cancel button receives focus when opened, prioritizing the safest action
- **Requires explicit dismissal**: Cannot be closed by clicking outside, only via button clicks or Escape key

**Example: alert-dialog**

#### React

```tsx
import { Dialog } from '@ark-ui/react/dialog'
import { Portal } from '@ark-ui/react/portal'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/dialog.module.css'

export const AlertDialog = () => (
  <Dialog.Root role="alertdialog">
    <Dialog.Trigger className={button.Root}>Delete Account</Dialog.Trigger>
    <Portal>
      <Dialog.Backdrop className={styles.Backdrop} />
      <Dialog.Positioner className={styles.Positioner}>
        <Dialog.Content className={styles.Content}>
          <Dialog.Title className={styles.Title}>Are you absolutely sure?</Dialog.Title>
          <Dialog.Description className={styles.Description}>
            This action cannot be undone. This will permanently delete your account and remove your data from our
            servers.
          </Dialog.Description>
          <div className={styles.Actions}>
            <Dialog.CloseTrigger className={button.Root}>Cancel</Dialog.CloseTrigger>
            <button className={button.Root} data-variant="solid">
              Delete Account
            </button>
          </div>
        </Dialog.Content>
      </Dialog.Positioner>
    </Portal>
  </Dialog.Root>
)

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Dialog } from '@ark-ui/solid/dialog'
import { XIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { Portal } from 'solid-js/web'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'

export const AlertDialog = () => (
  <Dialog.Root role="alertdialog">
    <Dialog.Trigger class={button.Root}>Delete Account</Dialog.Trigger>
    <Portal>
      <Dialog.Backdrop class={styles.Backdrop} />
      <Dialog.Positioner class={styles.Positioner}>

    </Teleport>
  </Dialog.Root>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Dialog } from '@ark-ui/svelte/dialog'
  import { Portal } from '@ark-ui/svelte/portal'
  import { XIcon } from 'lucide-svelte'
  import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
  import styles from 'styles/dialog.module.css'
</script>

<Dialog.Root role="alertdialog">

  <Portal>
    <Dialog.Backdrop class={styles.Backdrop} />
    <Dialog.Positioner class={styles.Positioner}>

        </div>
      </Dialog.Content>
    </Dialog.Positioner>
  </Portal>
</Dialog.Root>

```

### Lazy Mount

Use `lazyMount` to render dialog content only when first opened. Combine with `unmountOnExit` to unmount when closed,
freeing up resources.

**Example: lazy-mount**

#### React

```tsx
import { Dialog } from '@ark-ui/react/dialog'
import { Portal } from '@ark-ui/react/portal'
import { XIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/dialog.module.css'

export const LazyMount = () => (
  <Dialog.Root lazyMount unmountOnExit>
    <Dialog.Trigger className={button.Root}>Open Dialog</Dialog.Trigger>
    <Portal>
      <Dialog.Backdrop className={styles.Backdrop} />
      <Dialog.Positioner className={styles.Positioner}>

### Initial Focus

Use `initialFocusEl` to control which element receives focus when the dialog opens.

**Example: initial-focus**

#### React

```tsx
import { Dialog } from '@ark-ui/react/dialog'
import { Portal } from '@ark-ui/react/portal'
import { XIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import { useRef } from 'react'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import field from 'styles/field.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/dialog.module.css'

export const InitialFocus = () => {
  const inputRef = useRef<HTMLInputElement>(null)

  return (
    <Dialog.Root initialFocusEl={() => inputRef.current}>
      <Dialog.Trigger className={button.Root}>Open Dialog</Dialog.Trigger>
      <Portal>
        <Dialog.Backdrop className={styles.Backdrop} />
        <Dialog.Positioner className={styles.Positioner}>
          <Dialog.Content className={styles.Content}>
            <Dialog.CloseTrigger className={styles.CloseTrigger}>
              <XIcon />
            </Dialog.CloseTrigger>
            <Dialog.Title className={styles.Title}>Edit Profile</Dialog.Title>
            <Dialog.Description className={styles.Description}>
              The first input will be focused when the dialog opens.
            </Dialog.Description>
            <div className={styles.Body}>
              <input ref={inputRef} className={field.Input} placeholder="Enter your name..." />
              <input className={field.Input} placeholder="Enter your email..." />

            <Dialog.Description class={styles.Description}>
              The name input will be focused when this dialog opens.
            </Dialog.Description>

```

#### Vue

```vue

        </div>
      </Dialog.Content>
    </Dialog.Positioner>
  </Portal>
</Dialog.Root>

```

### Final Focus

Use `finalFocusEl` to control which element receives focus when the dialog closes. Defaults to the trigger element.

**Example: final-focus**

#### React

```tsx
import { Dialog } from '@ark-ui/react/dialog'
import { Portal } from '@ark-ui/react/portal'
import { XIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import { useRef } from 'react'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/dialog.module.css'

export const FinalFocus = () => {
  const finalRef = useRef<HTMLButtonElement>(null)

  return (
    <div className="stack">
      <button className={button.Root} ref={finalRef}>
        I will receive focus when dialog closes
      </button>
      <Dialog.Root finalFocusEl={() => finalRef.current}>
        <Dialog.Trigger className={button.Root}>Open Dialog</Dialog.Trigger>
        <Portal>
          <Dialog.Backdrop className={styles.Backdrop} />
          <Dialog.Positioner className={styles.Positioner}>
            <Dialog.Content className={styles.Content}>
              <Dialog.CloseTrigger className={styles.CloseTrigger}>
                <XIcon />
              </Dialog.CloseTrigger>
              <Dialog.Title className={styles.Title}>Focus Redirect</Dialog.Title>
              <Dialog.Description className={styles.Description}>
                When this dialog closes, focus will return to the button above instead of the trigger.
              </Dialog.Description>
            </Dialog.Content>
          </Dialog.Positioner>
        </Portal>
      </Dialog.Root>
    </div>
  )
}

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Dialog } from '@ark-ui/solid/dialog'
import { XIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { Portal } from 'solid-js/web'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/dialog.module.css'

export const FinalFocus = () => {
  let buttonRef: HTMLButtonElement | undefined

  return (
    <>
      <button ref={buttonRef} class={button.Root}>
        Focus Target
      </button>
      <Dialog.Root finalFocusEl={() => buttonRef!}>
        <Dialog.Trigger class={button.Root}>Open Dialog</Dialog.Trigger>
        <Portal>
          <Dialog.Backdrop class={styles.Backdrop} />
          <Dialog.Positioner class={styles.Positioner}>
            <Dialog.Content class={styles.Content}>
              <Dialog.CloseTrigger class={styles.CloseTrigger}>
                <XIcon />
              </Dialog.CloseTrigger>
              <Dialog.Title class={styles.Title}>Custom Focus Return</Dialog.Title>
              <Dialog.Description class={styles.Description}>
                When this dialog closes, focus will return to the "Focus Target" button instead of the trigger.
              </Dialog.Description>
            </Dialog.Content>
          </Dialog.Positioner>
        </Portal>

          </Dialog.Description>
        </Dialog.Content>
      </Dialog.Positioner>
    </Teleport>
  </Dialog.Root>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Dialog } from '@ark-ui/svelte/dialog'
  import { Portal } from '@ark-ui/svelte/portal'
  import { XIcon } from 'lucide-svelte'
  import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
  import styles from 'styles/dialog.module.css'

  let buttonRef: HTMLButtonElement
</script>

<button bind:this={buttonRef} class={button.Root}>Focus Target</button>
<Dialog.Root finalFocusEl={() => buttonRef}>

        </Dialog.Description>
      </Dialog.Content>
    </Dialog.Positioner>
  </Portal>
</Dialog.Root>

```

### Non-Modal

Use `modal={false}` to allow interaction with elements outside the dialog. Disables focus trapping and scroll
prevention.

**Example: non-modal**

#### React

```tsx
import { Dialog } from '@ark-ui/react/dialog'
import { Portal } from '@ark-ui/react/portal'
import { XIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/dialog.module.css'

export const NonModal = () => (
  <Dialog.Root modal={false}>
    <Dialog.Trigger className={button.Root}>Open Non-Modal Dialog</Dialog.Trigger>
    <Portal>
      <Dialog.Backdrop className={styles.Backdrop} />
      <Dialog.Positioner className={styles.Positioner}>
        <Dialog.Content className={styles.Content}>
          <Dialog.CloseTrigger className={styles.CloseTrigger}>
            <XIcon />
          </Dialog.CloseTrigger>
          <Dialog.Title className={styles.Title}>Non-Modal Dialog</Dialog.Title>
          <Dialog.Description className={styles.Description}>
            This dialog allows interaction with elements outside. You can click buttons, select text, and interact with
            the page behind it.
          </Dialog.Description>
        </Dialog.Content>
      </Dialog.Positioner>
    </Portal>
  </Dialog.Root>
)

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Dialog } from '@ark-ui/solid/dialog'
import { XIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { Portal } from 'solid-js/web'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'

    <Portal>
      <Dialog.Backdrop class={styles.Backdrop} />
      <Dialog.Positioner class={styles.Positioner}>
        <Dialog.Content class={styles.Content}>
          <Dialog.CloseTrigger class={styles.CloseTrigger}>
            <XIcon />
          </Dialog.CloseTrigger>
          <Dialog.Title class={styles.Title}>Non-Modal Dialog</Dialog.Title>
          <Dialog.Description class={styles.Description}>
            This dialog allows interaction with elements outside while open.

import { XIcon } from 'lucide-vue-next'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/dialog.module.css'
</script>

<template>
  <Dialog.Root :modal="false">
    <Dialog.Trigger :class="button.Root">Open Non-Modal</Dialog.Trigger>
    <Teleport to="body">

### Inside Scroll

Make the content area scrollable while keeping header and footer fixed using `maxHeight` and `overflow: auto`.

**Example: inside-scroll**

#### React

```tsx
import { Dialog } from '@ark-ui/react/dialog'
import { Portal } from '@ark-ui/react/portal'
import { XIcon } from 'lucide-react'

export const InsideScroll = () => (
  <Dialog.Root>
    <Dialog.Trigger className={button.Root}>Open Dialog</Dialog.Trigger>
    <Portal>
      <Dialog.Backdrop className={styles.Backdrop} />
      <Dialog.Positioner className={styles.Positioner}>
        <Dialog.Content className={styles.Content} style={{ maxHeight: 'min(32rem, calc(100vh - 4rem))' }}>
          <Dialog.CloseTrigger className={styles.CloseTrigger}>
            <XIcon />
          </Dialog.CloseTrigger>
          <Dialog.Title className={styles.Title}>Terms of Service</Dialog.Title>
          <Dialog.Description className={styles.Description}>
            Please review our terms before continuing.
          </Dialog.Description>
          <div className={styles.ScrollContainer}>
            {CONTENT_SECTIONS.map((item) => (
              <section key={item.title} className={styles.ScrollSection}>
                <h3>{item.title}</h3>
                <p>{item.body}</p>
              </section>
            ))}
          </div>
          <div className={styles.Actions}>

### Outside Scroll

Make the positioner scrollable so the dialog can extend beyond the viewport.

**Example: outside-scroll**

  return (
    <Dialog.Root initialFocusEl={() => contentRef.current}>
      <Dialog.Trigger className={button.Root}>Open Dialog</Dialog.Trigger>

### Context

Use the `Dialog.Context` component to access the dialog's state and methods.

**Example: context**

#### React

```tsx
import { Dialog } from '@ark-ui/react/dialog'
import { Portal } from '@ark-ui/react/portal'
import { XIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/dialog.module.css'

export const Context = () => (
  <Dialog.Root>
    <Dialog.Trigger className={button.Root}>Open Dialog</Dialog.Trigger>
    <Portal>
      <Dialog.Backdrop className={styles.Backdrop} />
      <Dialog.Positioner className={styles.Positioner}>
        <Dialog.Content className={styles.Content}>
          <Dialog.CloseTrigger className={styles.CloseTrigger}>
            <XIcon />
          </Dialog.CloseTrigger>
          <Dialog.Title className={styles.Title}>Status</Dialog.Title>
          <Dialog.Description className={styles.Description}>
            <Dialog.Context>{(dialog) => <span>Dialog is {dialog.open ? 'open' : 'closed'}</span>}</Dialog.Context>
          </Dialog.Description>
        </Dialog.Content>
      </Dialog.Positioner>
    </Portal>
  </Dialog.Root>
)

```

### Open from Menu

Open a dialog imperatively from a menu item using the `onClick` handler.

**Example: open-from-menu**

import dialog from 'styles/dialog.module.css'
import menu from 'styles/menu.module.css'

export const OpenFromMenu = () => {
  const [open, setOpen] = useState(false)
  return (
    <>
      <Menu.Root>
        <Menu.Trigger className={menu.Trigger}>
          Actions
          <Menu.Indicator className={menu.Indicator}>

### Nested

Nest dialogs within one another. The parent receives `data-has-nested` and `--nested-layer-count` CSS variable for
styling effects like zoom-out:

```css
[data-part='content'][data-has-nested] {
  transform: scale(calc(1 - var(--nested-layer-count) * 0.05));
}
```

**Example: nested**

#### React

```tsx

## Guides

### Close Behavior

- `closeOnEscape={false}` - Prevent closing on <kbd>Escape</kbd>
- `closeOnInteractOutside={false}` - Prevent closing on outside click

For conditional control, use `onEscapeKeyDown` or `onInteractOutside` with `e.preventDefault()`.

### Z-Index Stacking

Use the `--layer-index` CSS variable for z-index management of stacked dialogs:

```css
[data-part='content'] {
  z-index: calc(var(--layer-index));
}
```

### Dynamic Imports

When using `lazyMount` with `React.lazy` or Next.js `dynamic`, wrap the imported component in `Suspense`:

```tsx
import { Dialog } from '@ark-ui/react/dialog'
import { Suspense } from 'react'
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic'

const HeavyComponent = dynamic(() => import('./HeavyComponent'))

export const Demo = () => (
  <Dialog.Root lazyMount>
    <Dialog.Trigger>Open</Dialog.Trigger>
    <Dialog.Content>
      <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
        <HeavyComponent />
      </Suspense>
    </Dialog.Content>
  </Dialog.Root>
)
```

export const Basic = () => (
  <Editable.Root class={styles.Root} placeholder="Enter text..." defaultValue="Hello World">
    <Editable.Label class={styles.Label}>Label</Editable.Label>
    <Editable.Area class={styles.Area}>
      <Editable.Input class={styles.Input} />
      <Editable.Preview class={styles.Preview} />
    </Editable.Area>
    <Editable.Control class={styles.Control}>

import { PencilIcon } from 'lucide-vue-next'
import styles from 'styles/editable.module.css'
</script>

<template>
  <Editable.Root :class="styles.Root" placeholder="Enter text..." defaultValue="Hello World">
    <Editable.Label :class="styles.Label">Label</Editable.Label>

</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Editable } from '@ark-ui/svelte/editable'

</script>

<Editable.Root class={styles.Root} placeholder="Enter text..." defaultValue="Hello World">
  <Editable.Label class={styles.Label}>Label</Editable.Label>
  <Editable.Area class={styles.Area}>
    <Editable.Input class={styles.Input} />

    <Editable.EditTrigger class={styles.EditTrigger}>
      <PencilIcon />
    </Editable.EditTrigger>
  </Editable.Control>
</Editable.Root>

```

### Controlled

Use the `value` and `onValueChange` props to control the editable state.

**Example: controlled**

#### React

```tsx
import { Editable } from '@ark-ui/react/editable'
import { PencilIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import { useState } from 'react'
import styles from 'styles/editable.module.css'

export const Controlled = () => {
  const [value, setValue] = useState('Hello World')

  return (
    <Editable.Root
      className={styles.Root}
      placeholder="Enter text..."
      value={value}
      onValueChange={(e) => setValue(e.value)}
    >
      <Editable.Label className={styles.Label}>Label</Editable.Label>
      <Editable.Area className={styles.Area}>
        <Editable.Input className={styles.Input} />
        <Editable.Preview className={styles.Preview} />
      </Editable.Area>
      <Editable.Control className={styles.Control}>
        <Editable.EditTrigger className={styles.EditTrigger}>
          <PencilIcon />
        </Editable.EditTrigger>
      </Editable.Control>
    </Editable.Root>
  )
}

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Editable } from '@ark-ui/solid/editable'
import { PencilIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { createSignal } from 'solid-js'
import styles from 'styles/editable.module.css'

export const Controlled = () => {
  const [value, setValue] = createSignal('Hello World')

  return (
    <Editable.Root
      class={styles.Root}
      placeholder="Enter text..."
      value={value()}
      onValueChange={(e) => setValue(e.value)}
    >
      <Editable.Label class={styles.Label}>Label</Editable.Label>
      <Editable.Area class={styles.Area}>
        <Editable.Input class={styles.Input} />
        <Editable.Preview class={styles.Preview} />
      </Editable.Area>
      <Editable.Control class={styles.Control}>
        <Editable.EditTrigger class={styles.EditTrigger}>
          <PencilIcon />
        </Editable.EditTrigger>
      </Editable.Control>
    </Editable.Root>
  )
}

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Editable } from '@ark-ui/vue/editable'
import { PencilIcon } from 'lucide-vue-next'
import { ref } from 'vue'
import styles from 'styles/editable.module.css'

const value = ref('Hello World')
</script>

<template>
  <Editable.Root :class="styles.Root" placeholder="Enter text..." v-model="value">
    <Editable.Label :class="styles.Label">Label</Editable.Label>
    <Editable.Area :class="styles.Area">
      <Editable.Input :class="styles.Input" />
      <Editable.Preview :class="styles.Preview" />
    </Editable.Area>
    <Editable.Control :class="styles.Control">
      <Editable.EditTrigger :class="styles.EditTrigger">
        <PencilIcon />
      </Editable.EditTrigger>
    </Editable.Control>
  </Editable.Root>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Editable } from '@ark-ui/svelte/editable'
  import PencilIcon from 'lucide-svelte/icons/pencil'
  import styles from 'styles/editable.module.css'

  let value = $state('Hello World')
</script>

<Editable.Root class={styles.Root} placeholder="Enter text..." {value} onValueChange={(e) => (value = e.value)}>
  <Editable.Label class={styles.Label}>Label</Editable.Label>
  <Editable.Area class={styles.Area}>
    <Editable.Input class={styles.Input} />
    <Editable.Preview class={styles.Preview} />
  </Editable.Area>
  <Editable.Control class={styles.Control}>
    <Editable.EditTrigger class={styles.EditTrigger}>
      <PencilIcon />
    </Editable.EditTrigger>
  </Editable.Control>
</Editable.Root>

```

### Root Provider

An alternative way to control the editable is to use the `RootProvider` component and the `useEditable` hook. This way
you can access the state and methods from outside the component.

**Example: root-provider**

#### React

```tsx
import { Editable, useEditable } from '@ark-ui/react/editable'
import { PencilIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import styles from 'styles/editable.module.css'

export const RootProvider = () => {
  const editable = useEditable({ defaultValue: 'Hello World' })

  return (
    <Editable.RootProvider className={styles.Root} value={editable}>
      <Editable.Label className={styles.Label}>Label</Editable.Label>
      <Editable.Area className={styles.Area}>
        <Editable.Input className={styles.Input} />
        <Editable.Preview className={styles.Preview} />
      </Editable.Area>
      <Editable.Control className={styles.Control}>
        <Editable.EditTrigger className={styles.EditTrigger}>
          <PencilIcon />
        </Editable.EditTrigger>
      </Editable.Control>
    </Editable.RootProvider>
  )
}

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Editable, useEditable } from '@ark-ui/solid/editable'
import { PencilIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import styles from 'styles/editable.module.css'

export const RootProvider = () => {
  const editable = useEditable({ defaultValue: 'Hello World' })

  return (
    <Editable.RootProvider class={styles.Root} value={editable}>
      <Editable.Label class={styles.Label}>Label</Editable.Label>
      <Editable.Area class={styles.Area}>
        <Editable.Input class={styles.Input} />
        <Editable.Preview class={styles.Preview} />
      </Editable.Area>
      <Editable.Control class={styles.Control}>
        <Editable.EditTrigger class={styles.EditTrigger}>
          <PencilIcon />
        </Editable.EditTrigger>
      </Editable.Control>
    </Editable.RootProvider>
  )
}

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Editable, useEditable } from '@ark-ui/vue/editable'
import { PencilIcon } from 'lucide-vue-next'
import styles from 'styles/editable.module.css'

const editable = useEditable({ defaultValue: 'Hello World' })
</script>

<template>
  <Editable.RootProvider :class="styles.Root" :value="editable">
    <Editable.Label :class="styles.Label">Label</Editable.Label>
    <Editable.Area :class="styles.Area">
      <Editable.Input :class="styles.Input" />
      <Editable.Preview :class="styles.Preview" />
    </Editable.Area>
    <Editable.Control :class="styles.Control">
      <Editable.EditTrigger :class="styles.EditTrigger">
        <PencilIcon />
      </Editable.EditTrigger>
    </Editable.Control>
  </Editable.RootProvider>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Editable, useEditable } from '@ark-ui/svelte/editable'
  import PencilIcon from 'lucide-svelte/icons/pencil'
  import styles from 'styles/editable.module.css'

  const editable = useEditable({ defaultValue: 'Hello World' })
</script>

<Editable.RootProvider class={styles.Root} value={editable}>
  <Editable.Label class={styles.Label}>Label</Editable.Label>

    <Editable.EditTrigger class={styles.EditTrigger}>
      <PencilIcon />
    </Editable.EditTrigger>
  </Editable.Control>
</Editable.RootProvider>

```

### Context

Use `Editable.Context` to access the editable state and show contextual UI like keyboard hints when editing.

**Example: context**

#### React

```tsx
import { Editable } from '@ark-ui/react/editable'
import { PencilIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import styles from 'styles/editable.module.css'

export const Context = () => (
  <Editable.Root className={styles.Root} placeholder="Enter text..." defaultValue="Hello World">
    <Editable.Label className={styles.Label}>Label</Editable.Label>
    <Editable.Area className={styles.Area}>
      <Editable.Input className={styles.Input} />
      <Editable.Preview className={styles.Preview} />
    </Editable.Area>
    <Editable.Context>
      {(editable) =>
        editable.editing ? (
          <span className={styles.HelperText}>Enter to save, Esc to cancel</span>
        ) : (
          <Editable.Control className={styles.Control}>
            <Editable.EditTrigger className={styles.EditTrigger}>
              <PencilIcon />
            </Editable.EditTrigger>
          </Editable.Control>
        )
      }
    </Editable.Context>
  </Editable.Root>
)

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Editable } from '@ark-ui/solid/editable'
import { PencilIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { Show } from 'solid-js'
import styles from 'styles/editable.module.css'

export const Context = () => (
  <Editable.Root class={styles.Root} placeholder="Enter text..." defaultValue="Hello World">
    <Editable.Label class={styles.Label}>Label</Editable.Label>
    <Editable.Area class={styles.Area}>
      <Editable.Input class={styles.Input} />
      <Editable.Preview class={styles.Preview} />
    </Editable.Area>
    <Editable.Context>
      {(editable) => (
        <Show
          when={editable().editing}
          fallback={
            <Editable.Control class={styles.Control}>
              <Editable.EditTrigger class={styles.EditTrigger}>
                <PencilIcon />
              </Editable.EditTrigger>
            </Editable.Control>
          }
        >
          <span class={styles.HelperText}>Enter to save, Esc to cancel</span>
        </Show>
      )}
    </Editable.Context>
  </Editable.Root>
)

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Editable } from '@ark-ui/vue/editable'
import { PencilIcon } from 'lucide-vue-next'
import styles from 'styles/editable.module.css'
</script>

<template>
  <Editable.Root :class="styles.Root" placeholder="Enter text..." defaultValue="Hello World">
    <Editable.Label :class="styles.Label">Label</Editable.Label>
    <Editable.Area :class="styles.Area">
      <Editable.Input :class="styles.Input" />
      <Editable.Preview :class="styles.Preview" />
    </Editable.Area>
    <Editable.Context v-slot="{ editing }">
      <span v-if="editing" :class="styles.HelperText">Enter to save, Esc to cancel</span>
      <Editable.Control v-else :class="styles.Control">
        <Editable.EditTrigger :class="styles.EditTrigger">
          <PencilIcon />
        </Editable.EditTrigger>
      </Editable.Control>
    </Editable.Context>
  </Editable.Root>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Editable } from '@ark-ui/svelte/editable'
  import PencilIcon from 'lucide-svelte/icons/pencil'
  import styles from 'styles/editable.module.css'
</script>

<Editable.Root class={styles.Root} placeholder="Enter text..." defaultValue="Hello World">
  <Editable.Label class={styles.Label}>Label</Editable.Label>
  <Editable.Area class={styles.Area}>
    <Editable.Input class={styles.Input} />
    <Editable.Preview class={styles.Preview} />
  </Editable.Area>
  <Editable.Context>
    {#snippet render(editable)}
      {#if editable().editing}
        <span class={styles.HelperText}>Enter to save, Esc to cancel</span>
      {:else}
        <Editable.Control class={styles.Control}>
          <Editable.EditTrigger class={styles.EditTrigger}>
            <PencilIcon />
          </Editable.EditTrigger>
        </Editable.Control>
      {/if}
    {/snippet}
  </Editable.Context>
</Editable.Root>

```

### Controls

In some cases, you might need to use custom controls to toggle the edit and read mode. We use the render prop pattern to
provide access to the internal state of the component.

**Example: controls**

#### React

```tsx
import { Editable } from '@ark-ui/react/editable'
import { CheckIcon, PencilIcon, XIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import styles from 'styles/editable.module.css'

export const Controls = () => (
  <Editable.Root className={styles.Root} defaultValue="Click edit to start">
    <Editable.Label className={styles.Label}>Label</Editable.Label>
    <Editable.Area className={styles.Area}>
      <Editable.Input className={styles.Input} />
      <Editable.Preview className={styles.Preview} />
    </Editable.Area>
    <Editable.Context>
      {(editable) => (
        <Editable.Control className={styles.Control}>
          {editable.editing ? (
            <>
              <Editable.SubmitTrigger className={styles.SubmitTrigger}>
                <CheckIcon />
              </Editable.SubmitTrigger>
              <Editable.CancelTrigger className={styles.CancelTrigger}>
                <XIcon />
              </Editable.CancelTrigger>
            </>
          ) : (
            <Editable.EditTrigger className={styles.EditTrigger}>
              <PencilIcon />
            </Editable.EditTrigger>
          )}
        </Editable.Control>
      )}
    </Editable.Context>
  </Editable.Root>
)

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Editable } from '@ark-ui/solid/editable'
import { CheckIcon, PencilIcon, XIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { Show } from 'solid-js'
import styles from 'styles/editable.module.css'

export const Controls = () => (
  <Editable.Root class={styles.Root} defaultValue="Click edit to start">
    <Editable.Label class={styles.Label}>Label</Editable.Label>
    <Editable.Area class={styles.Area}>
      <Editable.Input class={styles.Input} />
      <Editable.Preview class={styles.Preview} />
    </Editable.Area>
    <Editable.Context>
      {(editable) => (
        <Editable.Control class={styles.Control}>
          <Show
            when={editable().editing}
            fallback={
              <Editable.EditTrigger class={styles.EditTrigger}>
                <PencilIcon />
              </Editable.EditTrigger>
            }
          >
            <Editable.SubmitTrigger class={styles.SubmitTrigger}>
              <CheckIcon />
            </Editable.SubmitTrigger>
            <Editable.CancelTrigger class={styles.CancelTrigger}>
              <XIcon />
            </Editable.CancelTrigger>
          </Show>
        </Editable.Control>
      )}
    </Editable.Context>
  </Editable.Root>
)

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Editable } from '@ark-ui/vue/editable'
import { CheckIcon, PencilIcon, XIcon } from 'lucide-vue-next'
import styles from 'styles/editable.module.css'
</script>

<template>
  <Editable.Root :class="styles.Root" defaultValue="Click edit to start">
    <Editable.Label :class="styles.Label">Label</Editable.Label>
    <Editable.Area :class="styles.Area">
      <Editable.Input :class="styles.Input" />
      <Editable.Preview :class="styles.Preview" />
    </Editable.Area>
    <Editable.Context v-slot="{ editing }">
      <Editable.Control :class="styles.Control">
        <template v-if="editing">
          <Editable.SubmitTrigger :class="styles.SubmitTrigger">
            <CheckIcon />
          </Editable.SubmitTrigger>
          <Editable.CancelTrigger :class="styles.CancelTrigger">
            <XIcon />
          </Editable.CancelTrigger>
        </template>
        <Editable.EditTrigger v-else :class="styles.EditTrigger">
          <PencilIcon />
        </Editable.EditTrigger>
      </Editable.Control>
    </Editable.Context>
  </Editable.Root>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Editable } from '@ark-ui/svelte/editable'
  import CheckIcon from 'lucide-svelte/icons/check'
  import PencilIcon from 'lucide-svelte/icons/pencil'

  <Editable.Area class={styles.Area}>
    <Editable.Input class={styles.Input} />
    <Editable.Preview class={styles.Preview} />
  </Editable.Area>
  <Editable.Context>
    {#snippet render(editable)}
      <Editable.Control class={styles.Control}>
        {#if editable().editing}

            <CheckIcon />
          </Editable.SubmitTrigger>
          <Editable.CancelTrigger class={styles.CancelTrigger}>
            <XIcon />
          </Editable.CancelTrigger>
        {:else}
          <Editable.EditTrigger class={styles.EditTrigger}>
            <PencilIcon />
          </Editable.EditTrigger>
        {/if}
      </Editable.Control>
    {/snippet}
  </Editable.Context>
</Editable.Root>

```

### Textarea

Use the `asChild` prop on `Editable.Input` to render a textarea for multi-line editing.

**Example: textarea**

#### React

```tsx
import { Editable } from '@ark-ui/react/editable'
import styles from 'styles/editable.module.css'

export const Textarea = () => (
  <Editable.Root
    className={styles.Root}
    placeholder="Enter a description..."
    defaultValue="Ark UI is a headless component library for building reusable, scalable design systems."
    activationMode="dblclick"
  >
    <Editable.Label className={styles.Label}>Description</Editable.Label>
    <Editable.Area className={styles.Area}>
      <Editable.Input className={styles.Textarea} asChild>
        <textarea />
      </Editable.Input>
      <Editable.Preview className={styles.Textarea} />
    </Editable.Area>
    <div className={styles.HelperText}>Press Cmd + Enter to save</div>
  </Editable.Root>
)

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Editable } from '@ark-ui/solid/editable'
import styles from 'styles/editable.module.css'

export const Textarea = () => (
  <Editable.Root
    class={styles.Root}
    placeholder="Enter a description..."
    defaultValue="Ark UI is a headless component library for building reusable, scalable design systems."
    activationMode="dblclick"
  >
    <Editable.Label class={styles.Label}>Description</Editable.Label>
    <Editable.Area class={styles.Area}>
      <Editable.Input class={styles.Textarea} asChild={(props) => <textarea {...props()} />} />
      <Editable.Preview class={styles.Textarea} />
    </Editable.Area>
    <div class={styles.HelperText}>Press Cmd + Enter to save</div>
  </Editable.Root>
)

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Editable } from '@ark-ui/vue/editable'
import styles from 'styles/editable.module.css'
</script>

<template>
  <Editable.Root
    :class="styles.Root"
    placeholder="Enter a description..."
    defaultValue="Ark UI is a headless component library for building reusable, scalable design systems."
    activationMode="dblclick"
  >
    <Editable.Label :class="styles.Label">Description</Editable.Label>
    <Editable.Area :class="styles.Area">
      <Editable.Input :class="styles.Textarea" asChild>
        <textarea />
      </Editable.Input>
      <Editable.Preview :class="styles.Textarea" />
    </Editable.Area>
    <div :class="styles.HelperText">Press Cmd + Enter to save</div>
  </Editable.Root>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Editable } from '@ark-ui/svelte/editable'
  import styles from 'styles/editable.module.css'
</script>

<Editable.Root
  class={styles.Root}
  placeholder="Enter a description..."
  defaultValue="Ark UI is a headless component library for building reusable, scalable design systems."
  activationMode="dblclick"
>
  <Editable.Label class={styles.Label}>Description</Editable.Label>
  <Editable.Area class={styles.Area}>
    <Editable.Input class={styles.Textarea}>
      {#snippet asChild(props)}
        <textarea {...props()}></textarea>
      {/snippet}
    </Editable.Input>
    <Editable.Preview class={styles.Textarea} />
  </Editable.Area>
  <div class={styles.HelperText}>Press Cmd + Enter to save</div>
</Editable.Root>

```

### Field

The `Field` component helps manage form-related state and accessibility attributes of an editable. It includes handling
ARIA labels, helper text, and error text to ensure proper accessibility.

**Example: with-field**

#### React

```tsx
import { Editable } from '@ark-ui/react/editable'
import { Field } from '@ark-ui/react/field'
import field from 'styles/field.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/editable.module.css'

export const WithField = () => (
  <Field.Root className={field.Root}>
    <Editable.Root className={styles.Root} placeholder="Enter your bio">
      <Editable.Label className={field.Label}>Bio</Editable.Label>
      <Editable.Area className={styles.Area}>
        <Editable.Input className={styles.Input} />
        <Editable.Preview className={styles.Preview} />
      </Editable.Area>
    </Editable.Root>
    <Field.HelperText className={field.HelperText}>Click to edit your bio</Field.HelperText>
    <Field.ErrorText className={field.ErrorText}>Bio is required</Field.ErrorText>
  </Field.Root>
)

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Editable } from '@ark-ui/solid/editable'
import { Field } from '@ark-ui/solid/field'
import field from 'styles/field.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/editable.module.css'

export const WithField = () => (
  <Field.Root class={field.Root}>
    <Editable.Root class={styles.Root} placeholder="Enter your bio">
      <Editable.Label class={field.Label}>Bio</Editable.Label>
      <Editable.Area class={styles.Area}>
        <Editable.Input class={styles.Input} />
        <Editable.Preview class={styles.Preview} />
      </Editable.Area>
    </Editable.Root>
    <Field.HelperText class={field.HelperText}>Double-click to edit your bio</Field.HelperText>
    <Field.ErrorText class={field.ErrorText}>Bio is required</Field.ErrorText>
  </Field.Root>
)

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Editable } from '@ark-ui/vue/editable'
import { Field } from '@ark-ui/vue/field'
import field from 'styles/field.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/editable.module.css'
</script>

<template>
  <Field.Root :class="field.Root">
    <Editable.Root :class="styles.Root" placeholder="Enter your bio">
      <Editable.Label :class="field.Label">Bio</Editable.Label>
      <Editable.Area :class="styles.Area">
        <Editable.Input :class="styles.Input" />
        <Editable.Preview :class="styles.Preview" />
      </Editable.Area>
    </Editable.Root>
    <Field.HelperText :class="field.HelperText">Double-click to edit your bio</Field.HelperText>
    <Field.ErrorText :class="field.ErrorText">Bio is required</Field.ErrorText>
  </Field.Root>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Editable } from '@ark-ui/svelte/editable'
  import { Field } from '@ark-ui/svelte/field'
  import field from 'styles/field.module.css'
  import styles from 'styles/editable.module.css'
</script>

<Field.Root class={field.Root}>
  <Editable.Root class={styles.Root} placeholder="Enter your bio">
    <Editable.Label class={field.Label}>Bio</Editable.Label>
    <Editable.Area class={styles.Area}>
      <Editable.Input class={styles.Input} />
      <Editable.Preview class={styles.Preview} />
    </Editable.Area>
  </Editable.Root>
  <Field.HelperText class={field.HelperText}>Double-click to edit your bio</Field.HelperText>
  <Field.ErrorText class={field.ErrorText}>Bio is required</Field.ErrorText>
</Field.Root>

```

## Guides

### Auto-resizing

To auto-grow the editable as the content changes, set the `autoResize` prop to `true`.

```tsx
<Editable.Root placeholder="Placeholder" autoResize>
  {/*...*/}
</Editable.Root>
```

### Max Length

Use the `maxLength` prop to set a maximum number of characters that can be entered into the editable.

```tsx
<Editable.Root placeholder="Placeholder" autoResize maxLength={10}>
  {/*...*/}
</Editable.Root>
```

### Double Click

The editable supports two modes of activating the "edit" state:

- when the preview part is focused (with pointer or keyboard).
- when the preview part is double-clicked.

To change the mode to double-click, pass the prop `activationMode="dblclick"`.

```tsx
<Editable.Root placeholder="Placeholder" activationMode="dblclick">
  {/*...*/}
</Editable.Root>
```

# Field



## Anatomy



```tsx
<Field.Root>
  <Field.Label />
  <Field.Input />
  <Field.Textarea />
  <Field.Select />
  <Field.HelperText />
  <Field.ErrorText />
</Field.Root>
```

## Examples

The `Field` component provides contexts such as `invalid`, `disabled`, `required`, and `readOnly` for form elements.
While most Ark UI components natively support these contexts, you can also use the `Field` component with standard HTML
form elements.

### Input

This example shows how to use the `Field` component with a standard input field.

**Example: input**

#### React

```tsx
import { Field } from '@ark-ui/react/field'
import styles from 'styles/field.module.css'

export const Input = () => (
  <Field.Root className={styles.Root}>
    <Field.Label className={styles.Label}>Label</Field.Label>
    <Field.Input className={styles.Input} />
    <Field.HelperText className={styles.HelperText}>Some additional Info</Field.HelperText>
    <Field.ErrorText className={styles.ErrorText}>Error Info</Field.ErrorText>
  </Field.Root>
)

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Field } from '@ark-ui/solid/field'
import styles from 'styles/field.module.css'

export const Input = () => (
  <Field.Root class={styles.Root}>
    <Field.Label class={styles.Label}>Label</Field.Label>
    <Field.Input class={styles.Input} />
    <Field.HelperText class={styles.HelperText}>Some additional Info</Field.HelperText>
    <Field.ErrorText class={styles.ErrorText}>Error Info</Field.ErrorText>
  </Field.Root>
)

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Field } from '@ark-ui/vue/field'
import styles from 'styles/field.module.css'
</script>

<template>
  <Field.Root :class="styles.Root">
    <Field.Label :class="styles.Label">Label</Field.Label>
    <Field.Input :class="styles.Input" />
    <Field.HelperText :class="styles.HelperText">Some additional Info</Field.HelperText>
    <Field.ErrorText :class="styles.ErrorText">Error Info</Field.ErrorText>
  </Field.Root>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Field } from '@ark-ui/svelte/field'
  import styles from 'styles/field.module.css'
</script>

<Field.Root class={styles.Root}>
  <Field.Label class={styles.Label}>Label</Field.Label>
  <Field.Input class={styles.Input} />
  <Field.HelperText class={styles.HelperText}>Some additional Info</Field.HelperText>
  <Field.ErrorText class={styles.ErrorText}>Error Info</Field.ErrorText>
</Field.Root>

```

### Textarea

This example illustrates how to use the `Field` component with a textarea element.

**Example: textarea**

#### React

```tsx
import { Field } from '@ark-ui/react/field'
import styles from 'styles/field.module.css'

export const Textarea = () => (
  <Field.Root className={styles.Root}>
    <Field.Label className={styles.Label}>Label</Field.Label>
    <Field.Textarea className={styles.Textarea} />
    <Field.HelperText className={styles.HelperText}>Some additional Info</Field.HelperText>
    <Field.ErrorText className={styles.ErrorText}>Error Info</Field.ErrorText>
  </Field.Root>
)

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Field } from '@ark-ui/solid/field'
import styles from 'styles/field.module.css'

export const Textarea = () => (
  <Field.Root class={styles.Root}>
    <Field.Label class={styles.Label}>Label</Field.Label>
    <Field.Textarea class={styles.Textarea} />
    <Field.HelperText class={styles.HelperText}>Some additional Info</Field.HelperText>
    <Field.ErrorText class={styles.ErrorText}>Error Info</Field.ErrorText>
  </Field.Root>
)

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Field } from '@ark-ui/vue/field'
import styles from 'styles/field.module.css'
</script>

<template>
  <Field.Root :class="styles.Root">
    <Field.Label :class="styles.Label">Label</Field.Label>
    <Field.Textarea :class="styles.Textarea" />
    <Field.HelperText :class="styles.HelperText">Some additional Info</Field.HelperText>
    <Field.ErrorText :class="styles.ErrorText">Error Info</Field.ErrorText>
  </Field.Root>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Field } from '@ark-ui/svelte/field'
  import styles from 'styles/field.module.css'
</script>

<Field.Root class={styles.Root}>
  <Field.Label class={styles.Label}>Label</Field.Label>

  <Field.HelperText class={styles.HelperText}>Some additional Info</Field.HelperText>
  <Field.ErrorText class={styles.ErrorText}>Error Info</Field.ErrorText>
</Field.Root>

```

### Textarea Autoresize

Pass the `autoresize` prop to the `Textarea` component to enable automatic resizing as the user types.

**Example: textarea-autoresize**

#### React

```tsx
import { Field } from '@ark-ui/react/field'
import styles from 'styles/field.module.css'

export const TextareaAutoresize = () => (
  <Field.Root className={styles.Root}>
    <Field.Label className={styles.Label}>Label</Field.Label>
    <Field.Textarea className={styles.Textarea} autoresize />
    <Field.HelperText className={styles.HelperText}>Some additional Info</Field.HelperText>
    <Field.ErrorText className={styles.ErrorText}>Error Info</Field.ErrorText>
  </Field.Root>
)

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Field } from '@ark-ui/solid/field'
import styles from 'styles/field.module.css'

export const TextareaAutoresize = () => (
  <Field.Root class={styles.Root}>
    <Field.Label class={styles.Label}>Label</Field.Label>
    <Field.Textarea class={styles.Textarea} autoresize />
    <Field.HelperText class={styles.HelperText}>Some additional Info</Field.HelperText>
    <Field.ErrorText class={styles.ErrorText}>Error Info</Field.ErrorText>
  </Field.Root>
)

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Field } from '@ark-ui/vue/field'
import styles from 'styles/field.module.css'
</script>

<template>
  <Field.Root :class="styles.Root">
    <Field.Label :class="styles.Label">Label</Field.Label>
    <Field.Textarea :class="styles.Textarea" autoresize />
    <Field.HelperText :class="styles.HelperText">Some additional Info</Field.HelperText>
    <Field.ErrorText :class="styles.ErrorText">Error Info</Field.ErrorText>
  </Field.Root>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Field } from '@ark-ui/svelte/field'
  import styles from 'styles/field.module.css'
</script>

<Field.Root class={styles.Root}>
  <Field.Label class={styles.Label}>Label</Field.Label>
  <Field.Textarea class={styles.Textarea} autoresize />
  <Field.HelperText class={styles.HelperText}>Some additional Info</Field.HelperText>
  <Field.ErrorText class={styles.ErrorText}>Error Info</Field.ErrorText>
</Field.Root>

```

### Select

This example demonstrates how to integrate the `Field` component with a select dropdown.

**Example: select**

#### React

```tsx
import { Field } from '@ark-ui/react/field'
import styles from 'styles/field.module.css'

export const Select = () => (
  <Field.Root className={styles.Root}>
    <Field.Label className={styles.Label}>Label</Field.Label>
    <Field.Select className={styles.Select}>
      <option value="1">Option 1</option>
      <option value="2">Option 2</option>
      <option value="3">Option 3</option>
    </Field.Select>
    <Field.HelperText className={styles.HelperText}>Some additional Info</Field.HelperText>
    <Field.ErrorText className={styles.ErrorText}>Error Info</Field.ErrorText>
  </Field.Root>
)

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Field } from '@ark-ui/solid/field'
import styles from 'styles/field.module.css'

export const Select = () => (
  <Field.Root class={styles.Root}>
    <Field.Label class={styles.Label}>Label</Field.Label>
    <Field.Select class={styles.Select}>
      <option value="1">Option 1</option>
      <option value="2">Option 2</option>
      <option value="3">Option 3</option>
    </Field.Select>
    <Field.HelperText class={styles.HelperText}>Some additional Info</Field.HelperText>
    <Field.ErrorText class={styles.ErrorText}>Error Info</Field.ErrorText>
  </Field.Root>
)

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Field } from '@ark-ui/vue/field'
import styles from 'styles/field.module.css'
</script>

<template>
  <Field.Root :class="styles.Root">
    <Field.Label :class="styles.Label">Label</Field.Label>
    <Field.Select :class="styles.Select">
      <option value="1">Option 1</option>
      <option value="2">Option 2</option>
      <option value="3">Option 3</option>
    </Field.Select>
    <Field.HelperText :class="styles.HelperText">Some additional Info</Field.HelperText>
    <Field.ErrorText :class="styles.ErrorText">Error Info</Field.ErrorText>
  </Field.Root>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Field } from '@ark-ui/svelte/field'
  import styles from 'styles/field.module.css'
</script>

<Field.Root class={styles.Root}>
  <Field.Label class={styles.Label}>Label</Field.Label>
  <Field.Select class={styles.Select}>
    <option value="1">Option 1</option>
    <option value="2">Option 2</option>
    <option value="3">Option 3</option>
  </Field.Select>
  <Field.HelperText class={styles.HelperText}>Some additional Info</Field.HelperText>
  <Field.ErrorText class={styles.ErrorText}>Error Info</Field.ErrorText>
</Field.Root>

```

### Checkbox

This example demonstrates how to integrate the `Field` and `Checkbox` components.

```tsx
import { Checkbox } from '@ark-ui/react/checkbox'
import { Field } from '@ark-ui/react/field'
import { CheckIcon, MinusIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import styles from 'styles/checkbox.module.css'
import field from 'styles/field.module.css'

export const WithField = () => (
  <Field.Root className={field.Root} data-inline>
    <Checkbox.Root className={styles.Root}>
      <Checkbox.Control className={styles.Control}>
        <Checkbox.Indicator className={styles.Indicator}>
          <CheckIcon />
        </Checkbox.Indicator>
        <Checkbox.Indicator className={styles.Indicator} indeterminate>
          <MinusIcon />
        </Checkbox.Indicator>
      </Checkbox.Control>
      <Checkbox.Label className={styles.Label}>Label</Checkbox.Label>
      <Checkbox.HiddenInput />
    </Checkbox.Root>
    <Field.HelperText className={field.HelperText}>Additional Info</Field.HelperText>
    <Field.ErrorText className={field.ErrorText}>Error Info</Field.ErrorText>
  </Field.Root>
)
```

### Root Provider

An alternative way to control the field is to use the `RootProvider` component and the `useField` hook. This way you can
access the state and methods from outside the component.

**Example: root-provider**

#### React

```tsx
import { Field, useField } from '@ark-ui/react/field'
import { useState } from 'react'
import styles from 'styles/field.module.css'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'

export const RootProvider = () => {
  const [invalid, setInvalid] = useState(false)
  const field = useField({ invalid })

  return (
    <>
      <button className={button.Root} style={{ marginBottom: '1rem' }} onClick={() => setInvalid((prev) => !prev)}>
        Toggle Invalid
      </button>
      <Field.RootProvider className={styles.Root} value={field}>
        <Field.Label className={styles.Label}>Label</Field.Label>
        <Field.Input className={styles.Input} />
        <Field.HelperText className={styles.HelperText}>Some additional Info</Field.HelperText>
        <Field.ErrorText className={styles.ErrorText}>Error Info</Field.ErrorText>
      </Field.RootProvider>
    </>
  )
}

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Field, useField } from '@ark-ui/solid/field'
import { createMemo, createSignal } from 'solid-js'
import styles from 'styles/field.module.css'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'

export const RootProvider = () => {
  const [invalid, setInvalid] = createSignal(false)
  const fieldProps = createMemo(() => ({
    invalid: invalid(),
  }))
  const value = useField(fieldProps)

  return (
    <>
      <button class={button.Root} style={{ 'margin-bottom': '1rem' }} onClick={() => setInvalid((prev) => !prev)}>
        Toggle Invalid
      </button>
      <Field.RootProvider class={styles.Root} value={value}>
        <Field.Label class={styles.Label}>Label</Field.Label>
        <Field.Input class={styles.Input} />
        <Field.HelperText class={styles.HelperText}>Some additional Info</Field.HelperText>
        <Field.ErrorText class={styles.ErrorText}>Error Info</Field.ErrorText>
      </Field.RootProvider>
    </>
  )
}

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Field, type UseFieldProps, useField } from '@ark-ui/vue/field'
import { computed, ref } from 'vue'
import styles from 'styles/field.module.css'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'

const invalid = ref(false)
const fieldProps = computed<UseFieldProps>(() => ({
  invalid: invalid.value,
}))

const field = useField(fieldProps)
</script>

<template>
  <button :class="button.Root" style="margin-bottom: 1rem" @click="invalid = !invalid">Toggle Invalid</button>

  <Field.RootProvider :class="styles.Root" :value="field">
    <Field.Label :class="styles.Label">Label</Field.Label>
    <Field.Input :class="styles.Input" />
    <Field.HelperText :class="styles.HelperText">Some additional Info</Field.HelperText>
    <Field.ErrorText :class="styles.ErrorText">Error Info</Field.ErrorText>
  </Field.RootProvider>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Field, useField } from '@ark-ui/svelte/field'
  import styles from 'styles/field.module.css'
  import button from 'styles/button.module.css'

  const id = $props.id()

  let invalid = $state(false)
  const field = useField({
    id,
    get invalid() {
      return invalid
    },
  })
</script>

<button class={button.Root} style="margin-bottom: 1rem" onclick={() => (invalid = !invalid)}>Toggle Invalid</button>
<Field.RootProvider class={styles.Root} value={field}>
  <Field.Label class={styles.Label}>Label</Field.Label>
  <Field.Input class={styles.Input} />
  <Field.HelperText class={styles.HelperText}>Some additional Info</Field.HelperText>
  <Field.ErrorText class={styles.ErrorText}>Error Info</Field.ErrorText>
</Field.RootProvider>

```

### Custom Control

Use the `Field.Context` or `useFieldContext` hook to access the internal state of the field.This can help you wire up
custom controls with the `Field` component.

**Example: custom-control**

#### React

```tsx
import { Field } from '@ark-ui/react/field'
import styles from 'styles/field.module.css'

export const CustomControl = () => (
  <Field.Root className={styles.Root} invalid>
    <Field.Label className={styles.Label}>Any Control</Field.Label>
    <Field.Context>{(context) => <input {...context.getInputProps()} />}</Field.Context>
    <Field.HelperText className={styles.HelperText}>Uses getInputProps() for maximum flexibility</Field.HelperText>
    <Field.ErrorText className={styles.ErrorText}>This field has an error</Field.ErrorText>
  </Field.Root>
)

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Field } from '@ark-ui/solid/field'
import styles from 'styles/field.module.css'

export const CustomControl = () => (
  <Field.Root class={styles.Root} invalid>
    <Field.Label class={styles.Label}>Any Control</Field.Label>
    <Field.Context>{(field) => <input {...field().getInputProps()} />}</Field.Context>
    <Field.HelperText class={styles.HelperText}>Uses getInputProps() for maximum flexibility</Field.HelperText>
    <Field.ErrorText class={styles.ErrorText}>This field has an error</Field.ErrorText>
  </Field.Root>
)

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Field } from '@ark-ui/vue/field'
import styles from 'styles/field.module.css'
</script>

<template>
  <Field.Root :class="styles.Root" invalid>
    <Field.Label :class="styles.Label">Any Control</Field.Label>
    <Field.Context v-slot="field">
      <input v-bind="field.getInputProps()" />
    </Field.Context>
    <Field.HelperText :class="styles.HelperText">Uses getInputProps() for maximum flexibility</Field.HelperText>
    <Field.ErrorText :class="styles.ErrorText">This field has an error</Field.ErrorText>
  </Field.Root>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Field } from '@ark-ui/svelte/field'
  import styles from 'styles/field.module.css'
</script>

<Field.Root class={styles.Root} invalid>
  <Field.Label class={styles.Label}>Any Control</Field.Label>
  <Field.Context>
    {#snippet render(field)}
      <input {...field().getInputProps()} />
    {/snippet}
  </Field.Context>
  <Field.HelperText class={styles.HelperText}>Uses getInputProps() for maximum flexibility</Field.HelperText>
  <Field.ErrorText class={styles.ErrorText}>This field has an error</Field.ErrorText>
</Field.Root>

```

## Examples

The `Fieldset` component provides contexts such as `invalid` and `disabled` for form elements. While most Ark UI
components natively support these contexts, you can also use the `Field` component with standard HTML form elements.

### Basic

**Example: basic**

#### React

```tsx
import { Field } from '@ark-ui/react/field'
import { Fieldset } from '@ark-ui/react/fieldset'
import field from 'styles/field.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/fieldset.module.css'

export const Basic = () => {
  return (
    <Fieldset.Root className={styles.Root}>
      <Fieldset.Legend className={styles.Legend}>Contact Details</Fieldset.Legend>

      <Field.Root className={field.Root}>
        <Field.Label className={field.Label}>Name</Field.Label>
        <Field.Input className={field.Input} placeholder="John Doe" />
      </Field.Root>

      <Field.Root className={field.Root}>
        <Field.Label className={field.Label}>Email</Field.Label>
        <Field.Input className={field.Input} type="email" placeholder="john@example.com" />
      </Field.Root>
    </Fieldset.Root>
  )
}

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Field } from '@ark-ui/solid/field'
import { Fieldset } from '@ark-ui/solid/fieldset'
import field from 'styles/field.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/fieldset.module.css'

export const Basic = () => {
  return (
    <Fieldset.Root class={styles.Root}>
      <Fieldset.Legend class={styles.Legend}>Contact Details</Fieldset.Legend>

      <Field.Root class={field.Root}>
        <Field.Label class={field.Label}>Name</Field.Label>
        <Field.Input class={field.Input} placeholder="John Doe" />
      </Field.Root>

      <Field.Root class={field.Root}>
        <Field.Label class={field.Label}>Email</Field.Label>
        <Field.Input class={field.Input} type="email" placeholder="john@example.com" />
      </Field.Root>
    </Fieldset.Root>
  )
}

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Field } from '@ark-ui/vue/field'
import { Fieldset } from '@ark-ui/vue/fieldset'
import field from 'styles/field.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/fieldset.module.css'
</script>

<template>
  <Fieldset.Root :class="styles.Root">
    <Fieldset.Legend :class="styles.Legend">Contact Details</Fieldset.Legend>

    <Field.Root :class="field.Root">
      <Field.Label :class="field.Label">Name</Field.Label>
      <Field.Input :class="field.Input" placeholder="John Doe" />
    </Field.Root>

    <Field.Root :class="field.Root">
      <Field.Label :class="field.Label">Email</Field.Label>
      <Field.Input :class="field.Input" type="email" placeholder="john@example.com" />
    </Field.Root>
  </Fieldset.Root>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Field } from '@ark-ui/svelte/field'
  import { Fieldset } from '@ark-ui/svelte/fieldset'
  import field from 'styles/field.module.css'
  import styles from 'styles/fieldset.module.css'
</script>

<Fieldset.Root class={styles.Root}>
  <Fieldset.Legend class={styles.Legend}>Contact Details</Fieldset.Legend>

  <Field.Root class={field.Root}>
    <Field.Label class={field.Label}>Name</Field.Label>
    <Field.Input class={field.Input} placeholder="John Doe" />
  </Field.Root>

  <Field.Root class={field.Root}>
    <Field.Label class={field.Label}>Email</Field.Label>
    <Field.Input class={field.Input} type="email" placeholder="john@example.com" />
  </Field.Root>
</Fieldset.Root>

```

### Field

This example demonstrates how to use the `Field` component with a standard input field within a `Fieldset`.

**Example: with-field**

#### React

```tsx
import { Field } from '@ark-ui/react/field'
import { Fieldset } from '@ark-ui/react/fieldset'
import field from 'styles/field.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/fieldset.module.css'

export const WithField = () => {
  return (
    <Fieldset.Root className={styles.Root}>
      <Fieldset.Legend className={styles.Legend}>Personal Information</Fieldset.Legend>

      <Field.Root className={field.Root}>
        <Field.Label className={field.Label}>First Name</Field.Label>
        <Field.Input className={field.Input} placeholder="Enter your first name" />
        <Field.HelperText className={field.HelperText}>As it appears on your ID</Field.HelperText>
      </Field.Root>

      <Field.Root className={field.Root}>
        <Field.Label className={field.Label}>Last Name</Field.Label>
        <Field.Input className={field.Input} placeholder="Enter your last name" />
      </Field.Root>
    </Fieldset.Root>
  )
}

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Field } from '@ark-ui/solid/field'
import { Fieldset } from '@ark-ui/solid/fieldset'
import field from 'styles/field.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/fieldset.module.css'

export const WithField = () => {
  return (
    <Fieldset.Root class={styles.Root}>
      <Fieldset.Legend class={styles.Legend}>Personal Information</Fieldset.Legend>

      <Field.Root class={field.Root}>
        <Field.Label class={field.Label}>First Name</Field.Label>
        <Field.Input class={field.Input} placeholder="Enter your first name" />
        <Field.HelperText class={field.HelperText}>As it appears on your ID</Field.HelperText>
      </Field.Root>

      <Field.Root class={field.Root}>
        <Field.Label class={field.Label}>Last Name</Field.Label>
        <Field.Input class={field.Input} placeholder="Enter your last name" />
      </Field.Root>
    </Fieldset.Root>
  )
}

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Field } from '@ark-ui/vue/field'
import { Fieldset } from '@ark-ui/vue/fieldset'
import field from 'styles/field.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/fieldset.module.css'
</script>

<template>
  <Fieldset.Root :class="styles.Root">
    <Fieldset.Legend :class="styles.Legend">Personal Information</Fieldset.Legend>

    <Field.Root :class="field.Root">
      <Field.Label :class="field.Label">First Name</Field.Label>
      <Field.Input :class="field.Input" placeholder="Enter your first name" />
      <Field.HelperText :class="field.HelperText">As it appears on your ID</Field.HelperText>
    </Field.Root>

    <Field.Root :class="field.Root">
      <Field.Label :class="field.Label">Last Name</Field.Label>
      <Field.Input :class="field.Input" placeholder="Enter your last name" />
    </Field.Root>
  </Fieldset.Root>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Field } from '@ark-ui/svelte/field'
  import { Fieldset } from '@ark-ui/svelte/fieldset'
  import field from 'styles/field.module.css'
  import styles from 'styles/fieldset.module.css'
</script>

<Fieldset.Root class={styles.Root}>
  <Fieldset.Legend class={styles.Legend}>Personal Information</Fieldset.Legend>

  <Field.Root class={field.Root}>
    <Field.Label class={field.Label}>First Name</Field.Label>
    <Field.Input class={field.Input} placeholder="Enter your first name" />
    <Field.HelperText class={field.HelperText}>As it appears on your ID</Field.HelperText>
  </Field.Root>

  <Field.Root class={field.Root}>
    <Field.Label class={field.Label}>Last Name</Field.Label>
    <Field.Input class={field.Input} placeholder="Enter your last name" />
  </Field.Root>
</Fieldset.Root>

```

### Checkbox

This example shows how to use the `Fieldset` component with other Ark UI form elements like `Checkbox`.

**Example: with-checkbox**

#### React

```tsx
import { Checkbox } from '@ark-ui/react/checkbox'
import { Fieldset } from '@ark-ui/react/fieldset'
import { CheckIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import checkbox from 'styles/checkbox.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/fieldset.module.css'

export const WithCheckbox = () => {
  return (
    <Fieldset.Root className={styles.Root}>
      <Fieldset.Legend className={styles.Legend}>Email Preferences</Fieldset.Legend>

      <Checkbox.Root className={checkbox.Root} defaultChecked>
        <Checkbox.Control className={checkbox.Control}>
          <Checkbox.Indicator className={checkbox.Indicator}>
            <CheckIcon />
          </Checkbox.Indicator>
        </Checkbox.Control>
        <Checkbox.Label className={checkbox.Label}>Product updates</Checkbox.Label>
        <Checkbox.HiddenInput />
      </Checkbox.Root>

      <Checkbox.Root className={checkbox.Root}>
        <Checkbox.Control className={checkbox.Control}>
          <Checkbox.Indicator className={checkbox.Indicator}>
            <CheckIcon />
          </Checkbox.Indicator>
        </Checkbox.Control>
        <Checkbox.Label className={checkbox.Label}>Marketing emails</Checkbox.Label>
        <Checkbox.HiddenInput />
      </Checkbox.Root>
    </Fieldset.Root>
  )
}

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Checkbox } from '@ark-ui/solid/checkbox'
import { Fieldset } from '@ark-ui/solid/fieldset'
import { CheckIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import checkbox from 'styles/checkbox.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/fieldset.module.css'

export const WithCheckbox = () => {
  return (
    <Fieldset.Root class={styles.Root}>
      <Fieldset.Legend class={styles.Legend}>Email Preferences</Fieldset.Legend>

      <Checkbox.Root class={checkbox.Root} defaultChecked>
        <Checkbox.Control class={checkbox.Control}>
          <Checkbox.Indicator class={checkbox.Indicator}>
            <CheckIcon />
          </Checkbox.Indicator>
        </Checkbox.Control>
        <Checkbox.Label class={checkbox.Label}>Product updates</Checkbox.Label>
        <Checkbox.HiddenInput />
      </Checkbox.Root>

      <Checkbox.Root class={checkbox.Root}>
        <Checkbox.Control class={checkbox.Control}>
          <Checkbox.Indicator class={checkbox.Indicator}>
            <CheckIcon />
          </Checkbox.Indicator>
        </Checkbox.Control>
        <Checkbox.Label class={checkbox.Label}>Marketing emails</Checkbox.Label>
        <Checkbox.HiddenInput />
      </Checkbox.Root>
    </Fieldset.Root>
  )
}

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Checkbox } from '@ark-ui/vue/checkbox'
import { Fieldset } from '@ark-ui/vue/fieldset'
import { CheckIcon } from 'lucide-vue-next'
import checkbox from 'styles/checkbox.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/fieldset.module.css'
</script>

<template>
  <Fieldset.Root :class="styles.Root">
    <Fieldset.Legend :class="styles.Legend">Email Preferences</Fieldset.Legend>

    <Checkbox.Root :class="checkbox.Root" defaultChecked>
      <Checkbox.Control :class="checkbox.Control">
        <Checkbox.Indicator :class="checkbox.Indicator">
          <CheckIcon />
        </Checkbox.Indicator>
      </Checkbox.Control>
      <Checkbox.Label :class="checkbox.Label">Product updates</Checkbox.Label>
      <Checkbox.HiddenInput />
    </Checkbox.Root>

    <Checkbox.Root :class="checkbox.Root">
      <Checkbox.Control :class="checkbox.Control">
        <Checkbox.Indicator :class="checkbox.Indicator">
          <CheckIcon />
        </Checkbox.Indicator>
      </Checkbox.Control>
      <Checkbox.Label :class="checkbox.Label">Marketing emails</Checkbox.Label>
      <Checkbox.HiddenInput />
    </Checkbox.Root>
  </Fieldset.Root>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Checkbox } from '@ark-ui/svelte/checkbox'
  import { Fieldset } from '@ark-ui/svelte/fieldset'
  import { CheckIcon } from 'lucide-svelte'
  import checkbox from 'styles/checkbox.module.css'
  import styles from 'styles/fieldset.module.css'
</script>

<Fieldset.Root class={styles.Root}>
  <Fieldset.Legend class={styles.Legend}>Email Preferences</Fieldset.Legend>

  <Checkbox.Root class={checkbox.Root} defaultChecked>
    <Checkbox.Control class={checkbox.Control}>
      <Checkbox.Indicator class={checkbox.Indicator}>
        <CheckIcon />
      </Checkbox.Indicator>
    </Checkbox.Control>
    <Checkbox.Label class={checkbox.Label}>Product updates</Checkbox.Label>
    <Checkbox.HiddenInput />
  </Checkbox.Root>

  <Checkbox.Root class={checkbox.Root}>
    <Checkbox.Control class={checkbox.Control}>
      <Checkbox.Indicator class={checkbox.Indicator}>
        <CheckIcon />
      </Checkbox.Indicator>
    </Checkbox.Control>
    <Checkbox.Label class={checkbox.Label}>Marketing emails</Checkbox.Label>
    <Checkbox.HiddenInput />
  </Checkbox.Root>
</Fieldset.Root>

```

### Root Provider

An alternative way to control the fieldset is to use the `RootProvider` component and the `useFieldset` hook. This way
you can access the state and methods from outside the component.

**Example: root-provider**

#### React

```tsx
import { Field } from '@ark-ui/react/field'
import { Fieldset, useFieldset } from '@ark-ui/react/fieldset'
import field from 'styles/field.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/fieldset.module.css'

export const RootProvider = () => {
  const fieldset = useFieldset()

  return (
    <Fieldset.RootProvider className={styles.Root} value={fieldset}>
      <Fieldset.Legend className={styles.Legend}>Contact Details</Fieldset.Legend>

      <Field.Root className={field.Root}>
        <Field.Label className={field.Label}>Name</Field.Label>
        <Field.Input className={field.Input} placeholder="John Doe" />
      </Field.Root>

      <Field.Root className={field.Root}>
        <Field.Label className={field.Label}>Email</Field.Label>
        <Field.Input className={field.Input} type="email" placeholder="john@example.com" />
      </Field.Root>
    </Fieldset.RootProvider>
  )
}

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Field } from '@ark-ui/solid/field'
import { Fieldset, useFieldset } from '@ark-ui/solid/fieldset'
import field from 'styles/field.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/fieldset.module.css'

export const RootProvider = () => {
  const fieldset = useFieldset()

  return (
    <Fieldset.RootProvider class={styles.Root} value={fieldset}>
      <Fieldset.Legend class={styles.Legend}>Contact Details</Fieldset.Legend>

      <Field.Root class={field.Root}>
        <Field.Label class={field.Label}>Name</Field.Label>
        <Field.Input class={field.Input} placeholder="John Doe" />
      </Field.Root>

      <Field.Root class={field.Root}>
        <Field.Label class={field.Label}>Email</Field.Label>
        <Field.Input class={field.Input} type="email" placeholder="john@example.com" />
      </Field.Root>
    </Fieldset.RootProvider>
  )
}

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Field } from '@ark-ui/vue/field'
import { Fieldset, useFieldset } from '@ark-ui/vue/fieldset'
import field from 'styles/field.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/fieldset.module.css'

const fieldset = useFieldset()
</script>

<template>
  <Fieldset.RootProvider :class="styles.Root" :value="fieldset">
    <Fieldset.Legend :class="styles.Legend">Contact Details</Fieldset.Legend>

    <Field.Root :class="field.Root">
      <Field.Label :class="field.Label">Name</Field.Label>
      <Field.Input :class="field.Input" placeholder="John Doe" />
    </Field.Root>

    <Field.Root :class="field.Root">
      <Field.Label :class="field.Label">Email</Field.Label>
      <Field.Input :class="field.Input" type="email" placeholder="john@example.com" />
    </Field.Root>
  </Fieldset.RootProvider>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Field } from '@ark-ui/svelte/field'
  import { Fieldset, useFieldset } from '@ark-ui/svelte/fieldset'
  import field from 'styles/field.module.css'
  import styles from 'styles/fieldset.module.css'

  const fieldset = useFieldset()
</script>

<Fieldset.RootProvider class={styles.Root} value={fieldset}>
  <Fieldset.Legend class={styles.Legend}>Contact Details</Fieldset.Legend>

  <Field.Root class={field.Root}>
    <Field.Label class={field.Label}>Name</Field.Label>
    <Field.Input class={field.Input} placeholder="John Doe" />
  </Field.Root>

  <Field.Root class={field.Root}>
    <Field.Label class={field.Label}>Email</Field.Label>
    <Field.Input class={field.Input} type="email" placeholder="john@example.com" />
  </Field.Root>
</Fieldset.RootProvider>

```

### Input with Select

This example shows how to use the `Fieldset` component with `Field.Input` and `Select` to create a interactive phone
input component.

**Example: phone-input**

#### React

```tsx
import { Field } from '@ark-ui/react/field'
import { Fieldset } from '@ark-ui/react/fieldset'
import { Portal } from '@ark-ui/react/portal'
import { Select, createListCollection } from '@ark-ui/react/select'
import { ChevronsUpDownIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import { useRef } from 'react'
import field from 'styles/field.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/fieldset.module.css'
import select from 'styles/select.module.css'

export const PhoneInput = () => {
  const extensions = createListCollection({
    items: [
      { label: '+1', value: '+1' },
      { label: '+44', value: '+44' },
      { label: '+49', value: '+49' },
      { label: '+41', value: '+41' },
    ],
  })

  const inputRef = useRef<HTMLInputElement | null>(null)
  const focusInput = () => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      inputRef.current?.focus()
    })
  }

  return (
    <Fieldset.Root className={styles.Root}>
      <Fieldset.Legend className={styles.Legend} onClick={focusInput}>
        Mobile Number
      </Fieldset.Legend>

      <div style={{ display: 'flex', alignItems: 'flex-start', gap: '0.5rem' }}>
        <Field.Root>
          <Select.Root className={select.Root} collection={extensions} defaultValue={['+1']} onValueChange={focusInput}>
            <Select.Control className={select.Control}>
              <Select.Trigger className={select.Trigger}>
                <Select.ValueText placeholder="Select" />
                <ChevronsUpDownIcon />
              </Select.Trigger>
            </Select.Control>
            <Portal>
              <Select.Positioner>
                <Select.Content className={select.Content}>
                  {extensions.items.map((item) => (
                    <Select.Item className={select.Item} key={item.value} item={item}>
                      <Select.ItemText className={select.ItemText}>{item.label}</Select.ItemText>
                    </Select.Item>
                  ))}
                </Select.Content>
              </Select.Positioner>
            </Portal>
            <Select.HiddenSelect />
          </Select.Root>
        </Field.Root>

        <Field.Root className={field.Root}>
          <Field.Input className={field.Input} ref={inputRef} />

    <FileUpload.HiddenInput />
  </FileUpload.Root>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { FileUpload } from '@ark-ui/svelte/file-upload'
  import { FileIcon } from 'lucide-svelte'
</script>

<FileUpload.Root maxFiles={5}>
  <FileUpload.Label>File Upload</FileUpload.Label>
  <FileUpload.Dropzone>Drag your file(s) here</FileUpload.Dropzone>
  <FileUpload.Trigger>Choose file(s)</FileUpload.Trigger>

  <!-- Custom Clear Trigger -->
  <FileUpload.Context>
    {#snippet render(context)}
      {#if context().acceptedFiles.length > 0}
        <button type="button" onclick={() => context().clearFiles()}>Clear Files</button>
      {/if}
    {/snippet}
  </FileUpload.Context>

  <FileUpload.ItemGroup>
    <FileUpload.Context>
      {#snippet render(context)}
        {#each context().acceptedFiles as file (file.name)}
          <FileUpload.Item {file}>
            <FileUpload.ItemPreview type="image/*">
              <FileUpload.ItemPreviewImage />
            </FileUpload.ItemPreview>
            <FileUpload.ItemPreview type=".*">
              <FileIcon />
            </FileUpload.ItemPreview>
            <FileUpload.ItemName />
            <FileUpload.ItemSizeText />
            <FileUpload.ItemDeleteTrigger>X</FileUpload.ItemDeleteTrigger>
          </FileUpload.Item>
        {/each}
      {/snippet}
    </FileUpload.Context>
  </FileUpload.ItemGroup>
  <FileUpload.HiddenInput />
</FileUpload.Root>

```

### Dropzone

Use the `Dropzone` to enable drag-and-drop. It exposes a `data-dragging` attribute for styling.

**Example: dropzone**

#### React

```tsx
import { FileUpload } from '@ark-ui/react/file-upload'
import { FileIcon, UploadIcon, XIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import styles from 'styles/file-upload.module.css'

export const Dropzone = () => (
  <FileUpload.Root maxFiles={5} className={styles.Root}>
    <FileUpload.Label className={styles.Label}>File Upload</FileUpload.Label>
    <FileUpload.Dropzone className={styles.Dropzone}>
      <UploadIcon className={styles.DropzoneIcon} />
      <div className={styles.DropzoneContent}>
        <span className={styles.DropzoneTitle}>Drag and drop files here</span>
        <span className={styles.DropzoneDescription}>or click to browse</span>
      </div>
    </FileUpload.Dropzone>
    <FileUpload.ItemGroup className={styles.ItemGroup}>
      <FileUpload.Context>
        {({ acceptedFiles }) =>
          acceptedFiles.map((file) => (
            <FileUpload.Item key={file.name} file={file} className={styles.Item}>
              <FileUpload.ItemPreview type="image/*" className={styles.ItemPreview}>
                <FileUpload.ItemPreviewImage className={styles.ItemPreviewImage} />
              </FileUpload.ItemPreview>
              <FileUpload.ItemPreview type=".*" className={styles.ItemPreview}>
                <FileIcon />
              </FileUpload.ItemPreview>
              <FileUpload.ItemName className={styles.ItemName} />
              <FileUpload.ItemSizeText className={styles.ItemSizeText} />
              <FileUpload.ItemDeleteTrigger className={styles.ItemDeleteTrigger}>
                <XIcon />
              </FileUpload.ItemDeleteTrigger>
            </FileUpload.Item>
          ))
        }
      </FileUpload.Context>
    </FileUpload.ItemGroup>
    <FileUpload.HiddenInput />
  </FileUpload.Root>
)

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { FileUpload } from '@ark-ui/solid/file-upload'
import { For } from 'solid-js'

export const Dropzone = () => (
  <FileUpload.Root maxFiles={5}>
    <FileUpload.Label>File Upload</FileUpload.Label>
    <FileUpload.Dropzone>Drag and drop files here</FileUpload.Dropzone>
    <FileUpload.ItemGroup>
      <FileUpload.Context>
        {(context) => (
          <For each={context().acceptedFiles}>
            {(file) => (
              <FileUpload.Item file={file}>
                <FileUpload.ItemPreview type="image/*">
                  <FileUpload.ItemPreviewImage />
                </FileUpload.ItemPreview>
                <FileUpload.ItemPreview type=".*">File</FileUpload.ItemPreview>

              </FileUpload.Item>
            )}
          </For>
        )}
      </FileUpload.Context>
    </FileUpload.ItemGroup>
    <FileUpload.HiddenInput />
  </FileUpload.Root>
)

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { FileUpload } from '@ark-ui/svelte/file-upload'
  import { FileIcon } from 'lucide-svelte'
</script>

<FileUpload.Root maxFiles={5}>

      {/snippet}
    </FileUpload.Context>
  </FileUpload.ItemGroup>

  <FileUpload.HiddenInput />
</FileUpload.Root>

```

### Directory Upload

Use the `directory` prop to upload entire folders. Access file paths through `file.webkitRelativePath`.

**Example: directory-upload**

#### React

```tsx
import { FileUpload } from '@ark-ui/react/file-upload'
import { FileIcon, FolderIcon, XIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import styles from 'styles/file-upload.module.css'

export const DirectoryUpload = () => (
  <FileUpload.Root directory className={styles.Root}>
    <FileUpload.Label className={styles.Label}>Upload Folder</FileUpload.Label>
    <FileUpload.Trigger className={styles.Trigger}>
      <FolderIcon style={{ width: '1rem', height: '1rem' }} />
      Select Folder
    </FileUpload.Trigger>
    <FileUpload.ItemGroup className={styles.ItemGroup}>
      <FileUpload.Context>
        {({ acceptedFiles }) =>
          acceptedFiles.map((file) => (
            <FileUpload.Item key={file.name} file={file} className={styles.Item}>
              <div className={styles.ItemPreview}>
                <FileIcon />
              </div>
              <FileUpload.ItemName className={styles.ItemName}>
                {file.webkitRelativePath || file.name}
              </FileUpload.ItemName>
              <FileUpload.ItemSizeText className={styles.ItemSizeText} />
              <FileUpload.ItemDeleteTrigger className={styles.ItemDeleteTrigger}>
                <XIcon />
              </FileUpload.ItemDeleteTrigger>
            </FileUpload.Item>
          ))
        }
      </FileUpload.Context>
    </FileUpload.ItemGroup>
    <FileUpload.HiddenInput />
  </FileUpload.Root>
)

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { FileUpload } from '@ark-ui/solid/file-upload'
import { For } from 'solid-js'

export const DirectoryUpload = () => (
  <FileUpload.Root directory>
    <FileUpload.Trigger>Upload Folder</FileUpload.Trigger>
    <FileUpload.ItemGroup>
      <FileUpload.Context>
        {(fileUpload) => (
          <For each={fileUpload().acceptedFiles}>
            {(file) => (
              <FileUpload.Item file={file}>
                <FileUpload.ItemName>{file.webkitRelativePath ?? file.name}</FileUpload.ItemName>
              </FileUpload.Item>
            )}
          </For>
        )}
      </FileUpload.Context>
    </FileUpload.ItemGroup>
    <FileUpload.HiddenInput />
  </FileUpload.Root>
)

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { FileUpload } from '@ark-ui/vue/file-upload'
</script>

<template>
  <FileUpload.Root directory>
    <FileUpload.Trigger>Upload Folder</FileUpload.Trigger>
    <FileUpload.ItemGroup>
      <FileUpload.Context v-slot="{ acceptedFiles }">
        <FileUpload.Item v-for="file in acceptedFiles" :file="file" :key="file.name">
          <FileUpload.ItemName>{{ file.webkitRelativePath ?? file.name }}</FileUpload.ItemName>
        </FileUpload.Item>
      </FileUpload.Context>
    </FileUpload.ItemGroup>
    <FileUpload.HiddenInput />
  </FileUpload.Root>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { FileUpload } from '@ark-ui/svelte/file-upload'
</script>

<FileUpload.Root directory>
  <FileUpload.Trigger>Upload Folder</FileUpload.Trigger>
  <FileUpload.ItemGroup>
    <FileUpload.Context>
      {#snippet render(fileUpload)}
        {#each fileUpload().acceptedFiles as file (file.name)}
          <FileUpload.Item {file}>
            <FileUpload.ItemName>
              {file.webkitRelativePath ?? file.name}
            </FileUpload.ItemName>
          </FileUpload.Item>
        {/each}
      {/snippet}
    </FileUpload.Context>
  </FileUpload.ItemGroup>
  <FileUpload.HiddenInput />
</FileUpload.Root>

```

> When uploading directories with many files, set `maxFiles` to a higher value or remove it entirely to prevent
> rejections.

### Accepted File Types

Use the `accept` prop to restrict file types. Accepts MIME types (`image/png`) or extensions (`.pdf`).

**Example: accepted-file-types**

#### React

```tsx
import { FileUpload } from '@ark-ui/react/file-upload'
import { AlertCircleIcon, ImageIcon, UploadIcon, XIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import styles from 'styles/file-upload.module.css'

export const AcceptedFileTypes = () => (
  <FileUpload.Root accept="image/png,image/jpeg" className={styles.Root}>
    <FileUpload.Label className={styles.Label}>Upload Images (PNG and JPEG only)</FileUpload.Label>
    <FileUpload.Dropzone className={styles.Dropzone}>
      <UploadIcon className={styles.DropzoneIcon} />
      <div className={styles.DropzoneContent}>
        <span className={styles.DropzoneTitle}>Drop your images here</span>
        <span className={styles.DropzoneDescription}>Only PNG and JPEG files</span>
      </div>
    </FileUpload.Dropzone>

    <FileUpload.Context>
      {({ acceptedFiles, rejectedFiles }) => (
        <>
          {acceptedFiles.length > 0 && (
            <FileUpload.ItemGroup className={styles.ItemGroup}>
              {acceptedFiles.map((file) => (
                <FileUpload.Item key={file.name} file={file} className={styles.Item}>
                  <FileUpload.ItemPreview type="image/*" className={styles.ItemPreview}>
                    <FileUpload.ItemPreviewImage className={styles.ItemPreviewImage} />
                  </FileUpload.ItemPreview>
                  <FileUpload.ItemPreview type=".*" className={styles.ItemPreview}>
                    <ImageIcon />
                  </FileUpload.ItemPreview>
                  <FileUpload.ItemName className={styles.ItemName} />
                  <FileUpload.ItemSizeText className={styles.ItemSizeText} />
                  <FileUpload.ItemDeleteTrigger className={styles.ItemDeleteTrigger}>
                    <XIcon />
                  </FileUpload.ItemDeleteTrigger>
                </FileUpload.Item>
              ))}
            </FileUpload.ItemGroup>
          )}

          {rejectedFiles.length > 0 && (
            <FileUpload.ItemGroup className={styles.ItemGroup}>
              {rejectedFiles.map((fileRejection) => (
                <FileUpload.Item
                  key={fileRejection.file.name}
                  file={fileRejection.file}
                  className={styles.Item}
                  data-rejected
                >
                  <div className={styles.ItemPreview}>

                  <div className={styles.ErrorList}>
                    {fileRejection.errors.map((error) => (
                      <div key={error} className={styles.ErrorItem}>
                        {error}
                      </div>
                    ))}
                  </div>
                </FileUpload.Item>
              ))}
            </FileUpload.ItemGroup>
          )}
        </>

### Error Handling

Set constraints with `maxFiles`, `maxFileSize`, `minFileSize`, and `accept`. Rejected files include error codes like
`TOO_MANY_FILES`, `FILE_INVALID_TYPE`, `FILE_TOO_LARGE`, or `FILE_EXISTS`.

**Example: error-handling**

#### React

```tsx
import { FileUpload, type FileUploadFileError } from '@ark-ui/react/file-upload'
import { AlertCircleIcon, CheckCircleIcon, FileIcon, UploadIcon, XIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import styles from 'styles/file-upload.module.css'

const errorMessages: Record<FileUploadFileError, string> = {
  TOO_MANY_FILES: 'Too many files selected (max 3 allowed)',
  FILE_INVALID_TYPE: 'Invalid file type (only images and PDFs allowed)',
  FILE_TOO_LARGE: 'File too large (max 1MB)',
  FILE_TOO_SMALL: 'File too small (min 1KB)',
  FILE_INVALID: 'Invalid file',
  FILE_EXISTS: 'File already exists',
}

export const ErrorHandling = () => (
  <FileUpload.Root
    maxFiles={3}
    maxFileSize={1024 * 1024}
    minFileSize={1024}
    accept="image/*,application/pdf"
    className={styles.Root}
  >
    <FileUpload.Label className={styles.Label}>Upload Documents</FileUpload.Label>
    <FileUpload.Dropzone className={styles.Dropzone}>
      <UploadIcon className={styles.DropzoneIcon} />
      <div className={styles.DropzoneContent}>
        <span className={styles.DropzoneTitle}>Drop files here</span>
        <span className={styles.DropzoneDescription}>Images and PDFs, max 1MB each</span>

### File Transformations

Use `transformFiles` to process files before they're added. Useful for image compression, format conversion, or
resizing.

**Example: transform-files**

#### React

```tsx
import { FileUpload } from '@ark-ui/react/file-upload'
import { compressAccurately } from 'image-conversion'
import { ImageIcon, XIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import styles from 'styles/file-upload.module.css'

export const TransformFiles = () => {
  const transformFiles = async (files: File[]) => {
    return Promise.all(
      files.map(async (file) => {
        if (file.type.startsWith('image/')) {
          try {
            const blob = await compressAccurately(file, 200)
            return new File([blob], file.name, { type: blob.type })
          } catch (error) {
            console.error('Compression failed for:', file.name, error)
            return file
          }
        }
        return file
      }),
    )
  }

  return (
    <FileUpload.Root accept="image/*" maxFiles={5} transformFiles={transformFiles} className={styles.Root}>
      <FileUpload.Label className={styles.Label}>Upload with Compression</FileUpload.Label>
      <FileUpload.Trigger className={styles.Trigger}>
        <ImageIcon style={{ width: '1rem', height: '1rem' }} />
        Choose Images
      </FileUpload.Trigger>
      <FileUpload.ItemGroup className={styles.ItemGroup}>
        <FileUpload.Context>
          {({ acceptedFiles }) =>
            acceptedFiles.map((file) => (
              <FileUpload.Item key={file.name} file={file} className={styles.Item}>
                <FileUpload.ItemPreview type="image/*" className={styles.ItemPreview}>
                  <FileUpload.ItemPreviewImage className={styles.ItemPreviewImage} />
                </FileUpload.ItemPreview>
                <FileUpload.ItemName className={styles.ItemName} />
                <FileUpload.ItemSizeText className={styles.ItemSizeText} />
                <FileUpload.ItemDeleteTrigger className={styles.ItemDeleteTrigger}>
                  <XIcon />
                </FileUpload.ItemDeleteTrigger>
              </FileUpload.Item>
            ))
          }
        </FileUpload.Context>
      </FileUpload.ItemGroup>
      <FileUpload.HiddenInput />
    </FileUpload.Root>
  )
}

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { FileUpload } from '@ark-ui/solid/file-upload'

      </FileUpload.Context>
    </FileUpload.ItemGroup>

    <FileUpload.HiddenInput />
  </FileUpload.Root>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { FileUpload } from '@ark-ui/svelte/file-upload'
  import { compressAccurately } from 'image-conversion'

  const transformFiles = async (files: File[]) => {
    return Promise.all(
      files.map(async (file) => {
        if (file.type.startsWith('image/')) {
          try {
            const blob = await compressAccurately(file, 200)
            return new File([blob], file.name, { type: blob.type })
          } catch (error) {
            console.error('Compression failed for:', file.name, error)
            return file
          }
        }
        return file
      }),
    )

      {/snippet}
    </FileUpload.Context>
  </FileUpload.ItemGroup>

  <FileUpload.HiddenInput />
</FileUpload.Root>

```

### Field

Use `Field` to add helper text and error handling.

**Example: with-field**

#### React

```tsx
import { Field } from '@ark-ui/react/field'
import { FileUpload } from '@ark-ui/react/file-upload'
import { FileIcon, UploadIcon, XIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import field from 'styles/field.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/file-upload.module.css'

export const WithField = () => (
  <Field.Root className={field.Root}>
    <FileUpload.Root maxFiles={5} className={styles.Root}>
      <FileUpload.Label className={styles.Label}>Attachments</FileUpload.Label>
      <FileUpload.Dropzone className={styles.Dropzone}>
        <UploadIcon className={styles.DropzoneIcon} />
        <div className={styles.DropzoneContent}>
          <span className={styles.DropzoneTitle}>Drop files here</span>
          <span className={styles.DropzoneDescription}>or click to browse</span>
        </div>
      </FileUpload.Dropzone>
      <FileUpload.ItemGroup className={styles.ItemGroup}>
        <FileUpload.Context>
          {({ acceptedFiles }) =>
            acceptedFiles.map((file) => (
              <FileUpload.Item key={file.name} file={file} className={styles.Item}>
                <FileUpload.ItemPreview type="image/*" className={styles.ItemPreview}>
                  <FileUpload.ItemPreviewImage className={styles.ItemPreviewImage} />
                </FileUpload.ItemPreview>
                <FileUpload.ItemPreview type=".*" className={styles.ItemPreview}>
                  <FileIcon />
                </FileUpload.ItemPreview>
                <FileUpload.ItemName className={styles.ItemName} />
                <FileUpload.ItemSizeText className={styles.ItemSizeText} />
                <FileUpload.ItemDeleteTrigger className={styles.ItemDeleteTrigger}>
                  <XIcon />
                </FileUpload.ItemDeleteTrigger>
              </FileUpload.Item>
            ))
          }
        </FileUpload.Context>
      </FileUpload.ItemGroup>
      <FileUpload.HiddenInput data-testid="input" />
    </FileUpload.Root>
    <Field.HelperText className={field.HelperText}>Upload up to 5 files</Field.HelperText>
    <Field.ErrorText className={field.ErrorText}>Please upload at least one file</Field.ErrorText>
  </Field.Root>
)

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Field } from '@ark-ui/solid/field'
import { FileUpload } from '@ark-ui/solid/file-upload'

export const WithField = (props: Field.RootProps) => (
  <Field.Root {...props}>
    <FileUpload.Root maxFiles={5}>
      <FileUpload.Label>Label</FileUpload.Label>
      <FileUpload.Trigger>Select</FileUpload.Trigger>
      <FileUpload.ItemGroup />
      <FileUpload.HiddenInput data-testid="input" />
    </FileUpload.Root>
    <Field.HelperText>Additional Info</Field.HelperText>
    <Field.ErrorText>Error Info</Field.ErrorText>
  </Field.Root>
)

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Field, type FieldRootProps } from '@ark-ui/vue/field'
import { FileUpload } from '@ark-ui/vue/file-upload'

const props = defineProps<FieldRootProps>()
</script>

<template>
  <Field.Root v-bind="props">
    <FileUpload.Root :maxFiles="5">
      <FileUpload.Label>Label</FileUpload.Label>
      <FileUpload.Trigger>Select</FileUpload.Trigger>
      <FileUpload.ItemGroup />
      <FileUpload.HiddenInput data-testid="input" />
    </FileUpload.Root>
    <Field.HelperText>Additional Info</Field.HelperText>
    <Field.ErrorText>Error Info</Field.ErrorText>
  </Field.Root>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Field } from '@ark-ui/svelte/field'
  import { FileUpload } from '@ark-ui/svelte/file-upload'
</script>

<Field.Root>
  <FileUpload.Root maxFiles={5}>
    <FileUpload.Label>Label</FileUpload.Label>
    <FileUpload.Trigger>Select</FileUpload.Trigger>
    <FileUpload.ItemGroup />
    <FileUpload.HiddenInput data-testid="input" />
  </FileUpload.Root>
  <Field.HelperText>Additional Info</Field.HelperText>
  <Field.ErrorText>Error Info</Field.ErrorText>
</Field.Root>

```

### Root Provider

An alternative way to control the file upload is to use the `RootProvider` component and the `useFileUpload` hook. This
way you can access the state and methods from outside the component.

**Example: root-provider**

#### React

```tsx
import { FileUpload, useFileUpload } from '@ark-ui/react/file-upload'
import { FileIcon, UploadIcon, XIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/file-upload.module.css'

export const RootProvider = () => {
  const fileUpload = useFileUpload({ maxFiles: 5 })

  return (
    <div className="stack">
      <button className={button.Root} onClick={() => fileUpload.clearFiles()}>
        Clear Files
      </button>
      <FileUpload.RootProvider value={fileUpload} className={styles.Root}>
        <FileUpload.Label className={styles.Label}>File Upload</FileUpload.Label>
        <FileUpload.Dropzone className={styles.Dropzone}>
          <UploadIcon className={styles.DropzoneIcon} />
          <div className={styles.DropzoneContent}>
            <span className={styles.DropzoneTitle}>Drop files here</span>
            <span className={styles.DropzoneDescription}>or click to browse</span>
          </div>
        </FileUpload.Dropzone>
        <FileUpload.ItemGroup className={styles.ItemGroup}>
          <FileUpload.Context>
            {({ acceptedFiles }) =>
              acceptedFiles.map((file) => (
                <FileUpload.Item key={file.name} file={file} className={styles.Item}>
                  <FileUpload.ItemPreview type="image/*" className={styles.ItemPreview}>
                    <FileUpload.ItemPreviewImage className={styles.ItemPreviewImage} />
                  </FileUpload.ItemPreview>
                  <FileUpload.ItemPreview type=".*" className={styles.ItemPreview}>
                    <FileIcon />
                  </FileUpload.ItemPreview>
                  <FileUpload.ItemName className={styles.ItemName} />
                  <FileUpload.ItemSizeText className={styles.ItemSizeText} />
                  <FileUpload.ItemDeleteTrigger className={styles.ItemDeleteTrigger}>
                    <XIcon />
                  </FileUpload.ItemDeleteTrigger>
                </FileUpload.Item>
              ))
            }
          </FileUpload.Context>
        </FileUpload.ItemGroup>
        <FileUpload.HiddenInput />
      </FileUpload.RootProvider>
    </div>
  )
}

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { FileUpload, useFileUpload } from '@ark-ui/solid/file-upload'
import { For } from 'solid-js'

export const RootProvider = () => {
  const fileUpload = useFileUpload({ maxFiles: 5 })

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => fileUpload().clearFiles()}>Clear</button>

      <FileUpload.RootProvider value={fileUpload}>
        <FileUpload.Label>File Upload</FileUpload.Label>

        <FileUpload.Trigger>Choose file(s)</FileUpload.Trigger>
        <FileUpload.ItemGroup>
          <FileUpload.Context>
            {(context) => (
              <For each={context().acceptedFiles}>
                {(file) => (
                  <FileUpload.Item file={file}>
                    <FileUpload.ItemPreview type="image/*">
                      <FileUpload.ItemPreviewImage />
                    </FileUpload.ItemPreview>
                    <FileUpload.ItemPreview type=".*">Any Icon</FileUpload.ItemPreview>
                    <FileUpload.ItemName />
                    <FileUpload.ItemSizeText />

                  </FileUpload.Item>
                )}
              </For>
            )}

const fileUpload = useFileUpload({ maxFiles: 5 })
</script>

<template>
  <button @click="fileUpload.clearFiles()">Clear</button>

  <FileUpload.RootProvider :value="fileUpload">

### Pasting Files

Use `setClipboardFiles` to enable pasting images from the clipboard.

**Example: pasting-files**

#### React

```tsx
import { FileUpload, useFileUpload } from '@ark-ui/react/file-upload'
import { ClipboardIcon, XIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import field from 'styles/field.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/file-upload.module.css'

export const PastingFiles = () => {
  const fileUpload = useFileUpload({ maxFiles: 3, accept: 'image/*' })

  return (
    <FileUpload.RootProvider value={fileUpload} className={styles.Root}>
      <FileUpload.Label className={styles.Label}>
        <ClipboardIcon
          style={{ width: '1rem', height: '1rem', display: 'inline', marginRight: '0.25rem', verticalAlign: 'middle' }}
        />
        Upload with Paste
      </FileUpload.Label>
      <textarea
        className={field.Textarea}
        placeholder="Paste an image here (Ctrl/Cmd + V)"
        onPaste={(e) => {
          fileUpload.setClipboardFiles(e.clipboardData)
        }}
      />
      <FileUpload.ItemGroup className={styles.ItemGroup}>
        {fileUpload.acceptedFiles.map((file) => (
          <FileUpload.Item key={file.name} file={file} className={styles.Item}>
            <FileUpload.ItemPreview type="image/*" className={styles.ItemPreview}>

      />
      <FileUpload.ItemGroup>
        <For each={fileUpload().acceptedFiles}>
          {(file) => (
            <FileUpload.Item file={file}>

### Media Capture

Use `capture` to access the device camera. Set to `"environment"` for back camera or `"user"` for front camera.

**Example: media-capture**

#### React

```tsx
import { FileUpload } from '@ark-ui/react/file-upload'
import { CameraIcon, FileIcon, XIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import styles from 'styles/file-upload.module.css'

  <FileUpload.Root capture="environment" className={styles.Root}>
    <FileUpload.Label className={styles.Label}>Capture Photo</FileUpload.Label>
    <FileUpload.Trigger className={styles.Trigger}>
      <CameraIcon style={{ width: '1rem', height: '1rem' }} />
      Open Camera
    </FileUpload.Trigger>
    <FileUpload.ItemGroup className={styles.ItemGroup}>
      <FileUpload.Context>
        {({ acceptedFiles }) =>
          acceptedFiles.map((file) => (
            <FileUpload.Item key={file.name} file={file} className={styles.Item}>
              <FileUpload.ItemPreview type="image/*" className={styles.ItemPreview}>
                <FileUpload.ItemPreviewImage className={styles.ItemPreviewImage} />

              <FileUpload.ItemPreview type=".*" className={styles.ItemPreview}>
                <FileIcon />
              </FileUpload.ItemPreview>
              <FileUpload.ItemName className={styles.ItemName}>

              <FileUpload.ItemDeleteTrigger className={styles.ItemDeleteTrigger}>
                <XIcon />
              </FileUpload.ItemDeleteTrigger>
            </FileUpload.Item>
          ))
        }
      </FileUpload.Context>
    </FileUpload.ItemGroup>
    <FileUpload.HiddenInput />
  </FileUpload.Root>
)

```

## Guides

### File Previews

Use `ItemPreview` with type matching to show appropriate previews based on file format.

- `type="image/*"`: Shows image thumbnails using `ItemPreviewImage`
- `type="video/*"`: For video file previews
- `type="application/pdf"`: For PDF files
- `type=".*"`: Generic fallback for any file type

```tsx
<FileUpload.ItemPreview type="image/*">
  <FileUpload.ItemPreviewImage />
</FileUpload.ItemPreview>

<FileUpload.ItemPreview type="video/*">
  <VideoIcon />
</FileUpload.ItemPreview>

<FileUpload.ItemPreview type="application/pdf">
  <PdfIcon />
</FileUpload.ItemPreview>

<FileUpload.ItemPreview type=".*">
  <FileIcon />
</FileUpload.ItemPreview>
```

### Disable Dropzone

To disable drag-and-drop functionality, set `allowDrop` to `false`.

```tsx
<FileUpload.Root allowDrop={false}>{/* ... */}</FileUpload.Root>
```

### Prevent Document Drop

By default, we prevent accidental navigation when files are dropped outside the dropzone. Set `preventDocumentDrop` to
`false` to disable this.

```tsx
<FileUpload.Root preventDocumentDrop={false}>{/* ... */}</FileUpload.Root>
```

### Prevent Double Open

Use `disableClick` on `Dropzone` when delegating clicks to a nested `Trigger`. This prevents the file picker from
opening twice.

```tsx
<FileUpload.Dropzone disableClick>
  <FileUpload.Trigger>Choose Files</FileUpload.Trigger>
  Drag files here
</FileUpload.Dropzone>
```

### Controlled size

To control the size of the floating panel programmatically, you can pass the `size` `onResize` prop to the machine.

**Example: controlled-size**

#### React

```tsx
import { FloatingPanel } from '@ark-ui/react/floating-panel'
import { Portal } from '@ark-ui/react/portal'
import { ArrowDownLeft, GripVertical, Maximize2, Minus, XIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import { useState } from 'react'
import styles from 'styles/floating-panel.module.css'

export const ControlledSize = () => {
  const [size, setSize] = useState({ width: 400, height: 300 })

  return (
    <FloatingPanel.Root size={size} onSizeChange={(e) => setSize(e.size)}>
      <FloatingPanel.Trigger className={styles.Trigger}>Toggle Panel</FloatingPanel.Trigger>
      <Portal>
        <FloatingPanel.Positioner className={styles.Positioner}>
          <FloatingPanel.Content className={styles.Content}>
            <FloatingPanel.DragTrigger>
              <FloatingPanel.Header className={styles.Header}>
                <FloatingPanel.Title className={styles.Title}>
                  <GripVertical />
                  Floating Panel
                </FloatingPanel.Title>
                <FloatingPanel.Control className={styles.Control}>
                  <FloatingPanel.StageTrigger stage="minimized" className={styles.ControlButton}>
                    <Minus />

                  <FloatingPanel.StageTrigger stage="maximized" className={styles.ControlButton}>
                    <Maximize2 />
                  </FloatingPanel.StageTrigger>
                  <FloatingPanel.StageTrigger stage="default" className={styles.ControlButton}>
                    <ArrowDownLeft />

            <FloatingPanel.Body className={styles.Body}>
              <p>Some content</p>
            </FloatingPanel.Body>

            <FloatingPanel.ResizeTrigger axis="n" className={styles.ResizeTrigger} />
            <FloatingPanel.ResizeTrigger axis="e" className={styles.ResizeTrigger} />
            <FloatingPanel.ResizeTrigger axis="w" className={styles.ResizeTrigger} />

      </Portal>
    </FloatingPanel.Root>

```

### Controlled position

To control the position of the floating panel programmatically, you can pass the `position` and `onPositionChange` prop
to the machine.

**Example: controlled-position**

#### React

```tsx
import { FloatingPanel } from '@ark-ui/react/floating-panel'
import { Portal } from '@ark-ui/react/portal'
import { ArrowDownLeft, GripVertical, Maximize2, Minus, XIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import { useState } from 'react'
import styles from 'styles/floating-panel.module.css'

export const ControlledPosition = () => {
  const [position, setPosition] = useState({ x: 200, y: 200 })

  return (
    <FloatingPanel.Root position={position} onPositionChange={(e) => setPosition(e.position)}>
      <FloatingPanel.Trigger className={styles.Trigger}>Toggle Panel</FloatingPanel.Trigger>
      <Portal>
        <FloatingPanel.Positioner className={styles.Positioner}>

### Anchor Position

Use the `getAnchorPosition` function to compute the initial position of the floating panel. This function is called when
the panel is opened and receives the `triggerRect` and `boundaryRect`.

**Example: anchor-position**

#### React

```tsx
import { FloatingPanel } from '@ark-ui/react/floating-panel'
import { Portal } from '@ark-ui/react/portal'
import { ArrowDownLeft, GripVertical, Maximize2, Minus, XIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import styles from 'styles/floating-panel.module.css'

export const AnchorPosition = () => (
  <FloatingPanel.Root
    getAnchorPosition={({ triggerRect }) => {
      if (!triggerRect) return { x: 0, y: 0 }
      return {
        x: triggerRect.x + triggerRect.width / 2,
        y: triggerRect.y + triggerRect.height / 2,
      }
    }}
  >

      </FloatingPanel.Content>
    </FloatingPanel.Positioner>
  </Portal>
</FloatingPanel.Root>

```

### Open State

To control the open state of the floating panel programmatically, you can pass the `open` and `onOpenChange` prop to the
machine.

**Example: controlled-open**

#### React

```tsx
import { FloatingPanel } from '@ark-ui/react/floating-panel'
import { Portal } from '@ark-ui/react/portal'
import { ArrowDownLeft, GripVertical, Maximize2, Minus, XIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import { useState } from 'react'
import styles from 'styles/floating-panel.module.css'

export const ControlledOpen = () => {
  const [open, setOpen] = useState(false)

  return (
    <FloatingPanel.Root open={open} onOpenChange={(e) => setOpen(e.open)}>
      <FloatingPanel.Trigger className={styles.Trigger}>Toggle Panel</FloatingPanel.Trigger>
      <Portal>
        <FloatingPanel.Positioner className={styles.Positioner}>
          <FloatingPanel.Content className={styles.Content}>
            <FloatingPanel.DragTrigger>
              <FloatingPanel.Header className={styles.Header}>
                <FloatingPanel.Title className={styles.Title}>

                  Floating Panel
                </FloatingPanel.Title>
                <FloatingPanel.Control className={styles.Control}>
                  <FloatingPanel.StageTrigger stage="minimized" className={styles.ControlButton}>
                    <Minus />
                  </FloatingPanel.StageTrigger>

                  <FloatingPanel.StageTrigger stage="default" className={styles.ControlButton}>
                    <ArrowDownLeft />
                  </FloatingPanel.StageTrigger>
                  <FloatingPanel.CloseTrigger className={styles.ControlButton}>
                    <XIcon />
                  </FloatingPanel.CloseTrigger>
                </FloatingPanel.Control>
              </FloatingPanel.Header>
            </FloatingPanel.DragTrigger>
            <FloatingPanel.Body className={styles.Body}>
              <p>Some content</p>
            </FloatingPanel.Body>

            <FloatingPanel.ResizeTrigger axis="n" className={styles.ResizeTrigger} />
            <FloatingPanel.ResizeTrigger axis="e" className={styles.ResizeTrigger} />
            <FloatingPanel.ResizeTrigger axis="w" className={styles.ResizeTrigger} />
            <FloatingPanel.ResizeTrigger axis="s" className={styles.ResizeTrigger} />

          </FloatingPanel.Content>
        </FloatingPanel.Positioner>
      </Portal>
    </FloatingPanel.Root>
  )
}

```

### Lazy Mount

To lazy mount the floating panel, you can pass the `lazyMount` prop to the machine.

**Example: lazy-mount**

#### React

```tsx
import { FloatingPanel } from '@ark-ui/react/floating-panel'
import { Portal } from '@ark-ui/react/portal'
import { ArrowDownLeft, GripVertical, Maximize2, Minus, XIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import styles from 'styles/floating-panel.module.css'

export const LazyMount = () => (
  <FloatingPanel.Root lazyMount onExitComplete={() => console.log('onExitComplete invoked')}>
    <FloatingPanel.Trigger className={styles.Trigger}>Toggle Panel</FloatingPanel.Trigger>
    <Portal>
      <FloatingPanel.Positioner className={styles.Positioner}>
        <FloatingPanel.Content className={styles.Content}>
          <FloatingPanel.DragTrigger>
            <FloatingPanel.Header className={styles.Header}>
              <FloatingPanel.Title className={styles.Title}>
                <GripVertical />
                Floating Panel
              </FloatingPanel.Title>
              <FloatingPanel.Control className={styles.Control}>
                <FloatingPanel.StageTrigger stage="minimized" className={styles.ControlButton}>
                  <Minus />
                </FloatingPanel.StageTrigger>
                <FloatingPanel.StageTrigger stage="maximized" className={styles.ControlButton}>

                <FloatingPanel.StageTrigger stage="default" className={styles.ControlButton}>
                  <ArrowDownLeft />
                </FloatingPanel.StageTrigger>
                <FloatingPanel.CloseTrigger className={styles.ControlButton}>
                  <XIcon />
                </FloatingPanel.CloseTrigger>
              </FloatingPanel.Control>

            </HoverCard.Content>
          </HoverCard.Positioner>
        </Portal>
      </HoverCard.Root>
    </div>
  )
}

```

```

### Root Provider

An alternative way to control the hover card is to use the `RootProvider` component and the `useHoverCard` hook. This
way you can access the state and methods from outside the component.

**Example: root-provider**

#### React

```tsx
import { HoverCard, useHoverCard } from '@ark-ui/react/hover-card'
import { Portal } from '@ark-ui/react/portal'
import styles from 'styles/hover-card.module.css'

export const RootProvider = () => {
  const hoverCard = useHoverCard()

  return (
    <div className="stack">
      <output>Open: {String(hoverCard.open)}</output>
      <HoverCard.RootProvider value={hoverCard}>
        <p>
          Liked by{' '}
          <HoverCard.Trigger className={styles.Trigger} asChild>
            <a href="#profile">@sarah_chen</a>
          </HoverCard.Trigger>{' '}
          and 3 others
        </p>
        <Portal>
          <HoverCard.Positioner>
            <HoverCard.Content className={styles.Content}>
              <HoverCard.Arrow className={styles.Arrow}>
                <HoverCard.ArrowTip className={styles.ArrowTip} />
              </HoverCard.Arrow>
              <div className={styles.Body}>
                <img className={styles.Avatar} src="https://i.pravatar.cc/300?u=sarah" alt="Sarah Chen" />
                <div>
                  <p className={styles.Name}>Sarah Chen</p>
                  <p className={styles.Username}>@sarah_chen</p>
                </div>
                <p className={styles.Bio}>Design Engineer at Acme Inc.</p>
              </div>
            </HoverCard.Content>
          </HoverCard.Positioner>
        </Portal>
      </HoverCard.RootProvider>
    </div>
  )
}

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { HoverCard, useHoverCard } from '@ark-ui/solid/hover-card'
import { Portal } from 'solid-js/web'
import styles from 'styles/hover-card.module.css'

export const RootProvider = () => {
  const hoverCard = useHoverCard()

  return (
    <div class="stack">
      <output>Open: {String(hoverCard().open)}</output>
      <HoverCard.RootProvider value={hoverCard}>
        <p>
          Liked by{' '}
          <HoverCard.Trigger
            class={styles.Trigger}
            asChild={(props) => (
              <a href="#profile" {...props()}>
                @sarah_chen
              </a>
            )}
          />{' '}
          and 3 others
        </p>

                <p class={styles.Bio}>Design Engineer at Acme Inc.</p>
              </div>
            </HoverCard.Content>

```

### Delay

Control the open and close delay of the hover card using the `openDelay` and `closeDelay` props:

**Example: delay**

#### React

```tsx
import { HoverCard } from '@ark-ui/react/hover-card'
import { Portal } from '@ark-ui/react/portal'
import styles from 'styles/hover-card.module.css'

export const Delay = () => (
  <HoverCard.Root openDelay={200} closeDelay={500}>
    <p>
      Liked by{' '}
      <HoverCard.Trigger className={styles.Trigger} asChild>
        <a href="#profile">@sarah_chen</a>
      </HoverCard.Trigger>{' '}
      and 3 others
    </p>
    <Portal>
      <HoverCard.Positioner>
        <HoverCard.Content className={styles.Content}>
          <HoverCard.Arrow className={styles.Arrow}>
            <HoverCard.ArrowTip className={styles.ArrowTip} />
          </HoverCard.Arrow>
          <div className={styles.Body}>
            <img className={styles.Avatar} src="https://i.pravatar.cc/300?u=sarah" alt="Sarah Chen" />
            <div>
              <p className={styles.Name}>Sarah Chen</p>
              <p className={styles.Username}>@sarah_chen</p>
            </div>
            <p className={styles.Bio}>Design Engineer at Acme Inc.</p>
          </div>

### Positioning

The `HoverCard` component can be customized in its placement and distance from the trigger element through the
`positioning` prop:

**Example: positioning**

#### React

```tsx
import { HoverCard } from '@ark-ui/react/hover-card'
import { Portal } from '@ark-ui/react/portal'
import styles from 'styles/hover-card.module.css'

export const Positioning = () => (
  <HoverCard.Root positioning={{ placement: 'right', gutter: 12 }}>
    <p>
      Liked by{' '}
      <HoverCard.Trigger className={styles.Trigger} asChild>
        <a href="#profile">@sarah_chen</a>
      </HoverCard.Trigger>{' '}
      and 3 others
    </p>
    <Portal>
      <HoverCard.Positioner>
        <HoverCard.Content className={styles.Content}>
          <HoverCard.Arrow className={styles.Arrow}>
            <HoverCard.ArrowTip className={styles.ArrowTip} />
          </HoverCard.Arrow>
          <div className={styles.Body}>
            <img className={styles.Avatar} src="https://i.pravatar.cc/300?u=sarah" alt="Sarah Chen" />
            <div>
              <p className={styles.Name}>Sarah Chen</p>
              <p className={styles.Username}>@sarah_chen</p>
            </div>
            <p className={styles.Bio}>Design Engineer at Acme Inc.</p>
          </div>
        </HoverCard.Content>
      </HoverCard.Positioner>
    </Portal>
  </HoverCard.Root>
)

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { HoverCard } from '@ark-ui/solid/hover-card'

# Listbox



## Anatomy

{/*  */}

```tsx
<Listbox.Root>
  <Listbox.Label />
  <Listbox.Content>
    <Listbox.ItemGroup>
      <Listbox.ItemGroupLabel />
      <Listbox.Item>
        <Listbox.ItemText />
        <Listbox.ItemIndicator />
      </Listbox.Item>
    </Listbox.ItemGroup>
  </Listbox.Content>
  <Listbox.ValueText />
</Listbox.Root>
```

## Examples

### Basic

Here's a basic example of the Listbox component.

**Example: basic**

#### React

```tsx
import { Listbox, createListCollection } from '@ark-ui/react/listbox'
import { CheckIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import styles from 'styles/listbox.module.css'

export const Basic = () => {
  const collection = createListCollection({
    items: [
      { label: 'United States', value: 'us' },
      { label: 'United Kingdom', value: 'uk' },
      { label: 'Canada', value: 'ca' },
      { label: 'Australia', value: 'au' },
      { label: 'Germany', value: 'de' },
      { label: 'France', value: 'fr' },
      { label: 'Japan', value: 'jp' },
    ],
  })

  return (
    <Listbox.Root className={styles.Root} collection={collection}>
      <Listbox.Label className={styles.Label}>Select Country</Listbox.Label>
      <Listbox.Content className={styles.Content}>
        {collection.items.map((item) => (
          <Listbox.Item className={styles.Item} key={item.value} item={item}>
            <Listbox.ItemText className={styles.ItemText}>{item.label}</Listbox.ItemText>
            <Listbox.ItemIndicator className={styles.ItemIndicator}>
              <CheckIcon />
            </Listbox.ItemIndicator>
          </Listbox.Item>
        ))}
      </Listbox.Content>
    </Listbox.Root>
  )
}

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Listbox, createListCollection } from '@ark-ui/solid/listbox'
import { CheckIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { Index } from 'solid-js'
import styles from 'styles/listbox.module.css'

export const Basic = () => {
  const collection = createListCollection({
    items: [
      { label: 'United States', value: 'us' },
      { label: 'United Kingdom', value: 'uk' },
      { label: 'Canada', value: 'ca' },
      { label: 'Australia', value: 'au' },
      { label: 'Germany', value: 'de' },
      { label: 'France', value: 'fr' },
      { label: 'Japan', value: 'jp' },
    ],
  })

  return (
    <Listbox.Root class={styles.Root} collection={collection}>
      <Listbox.Label class={styles.Label}>Select Country</Listbox.Label>
      <Listbox.Content class={styles.Content}>
        <Index each={collection.items}>
          {(item) => (
            <Listbox.Item class={styles.Item} item={item()}>
              <Listbox.ItemText class={styles.ItemText}>{item().label}</Listbox.ItemText>
              <Listbox.ItemIndicator class={styles.ItemIndicator}>
                <CheckIcon />
              </Listbox.ItemIndicator>
            </Listbox.Item>
          )}
        </Index>
      </Listbox.Content>
    </Listbox.Root>
  )
}

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Listbox, createListCollection } from '@ark-ui/vue/listbox'
import { CheckIcon } from 'lucide-vue-next'
import styles from 'styles/listbox.module.css'

const collection = createListCollection({
  items: [
    { label: 'United States', value: 'us' },
    { label: 'United Kingdom', value: 'uk' },
    { label: 'Canada', value: 'ca' },
    { label: 'Australia', value: 'au' },
    { label: 'Germany', value: 'de' },
    { label: 'France', value: 'fr' },
    { label: 'Japan', value: 'jp' },
  ],
})
</script>

<template>
  <Listbox.Root :class="styles.Root" :collection="collection">
    <Listbox.Label :class="styles.Label">Select Country</Listbox.Label>
    <Listbox.Content :class="styles.Content">
      <Listbox.Item v-for="item in collection.items" :key="item.value" :class="styles.Item" :item="item">
        <Listbox.ItemText :class="styles.ItemText">{{ item.label }}</Listbox.ItemText>
        <Listbox.ItemIndicator :class="styles.ItemIndicator">
          <CheckIcon />
        </Listbox.ItemIndicator>
      </Listbox.Item>
    </Listbox.Content>
  </Listbox.Root>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Listbox, createListCollection } from '@ark-ui/svelte/listbox'
  import CheckIcon from 'lucide-svelte/icons/check'
  import styles from 'styles/listbox.module.css'

  const collection = createListCollection({
    items: [
      { label: 'United States', value: 'us' },
      { label: 'United Kingdom', value: 'uk' },
      { label: 'Canada', value: 'ca' },
      { label: 'Australia', value: 'au' },
      { label: 'Germany', value: 'de' },
      { label: 'France', value: 'fr' },
      { label: 'Japan', value: 'jp' },
    ],
  })
</script>

<Listbox.Root class={styles.Root} {collection}>
  <Listbox.Label class={styles.Label}>Select Country</Listbox.Label>
  <Listbox.Content class={styles.Content}>
    {#each collection.items as item (item.value)}
      <Listbox.Item class={styles.Item} {item}>
        <Listbox.ItemText class={styles.ItemText}>{item.label}</Listbox.ItemText>
        <Listbox.ItemIndicator class={styles.ItemIndicator}>
          <CheckIcon />
        </Listbox.ItemIndicator>
      </Listbox.Item>
    {/each}
  </Listbox.Content>
</Listbox.Root>

```

### Controlled

The Listbox component can be controlled by using the `value` and `onValueChange` props. This allows you to manage the
selected value externally.

**Example: controlled**

#### React

```tsx
import { Listbox, createListCollection } from '@ark-ui/react/listbox'
import { CheckIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import { useState } from 'react'
import styles from 'styles/listbox.module.css'

export const Controlled = () => {
  const collection = createListCollection({
    items: [
      { label: 'Small', value: 'sm' },
      { label: 'Medium', value: 'md' },
      { label: 'Large', value: 'lg' },
      { label: 'Extra Large', value: 'xl' },
    ],
  })
  const [value, setValue] = useState(['md'])

  return (
    <Listbox.Root
      className={styles.Root}
      collection={collection}
      value={value}
      onValueChange={(e) => setValue(e.value)}
    >
      <Listbox.Label className={styles.Label}>Select Size</Listbox.Label>
      <Listbox.Content className={styles.Content}>
        {collection.items.map((item) => (
          <Listbox.Item className={styles.Item} key={item.value} item={item}>
            <Listbox.ItemText className={styles.ItemText}>{item.label}</Listbox.ItemText>
            <Listbox.ItemIndicator className={styles.ItemIndicator}>
              <CheckIcon />
            </Listbox.ItemIndicator>
          </Listbox.Item>
        ))}
      </Listbox.Content>
    </Listbox.Root>
  )
}

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Listbox, createListCollection } from '@ark-ui/solid/listbox'
import { CheckIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { Index, createSignal } from 'solid-js'
import styles from 'styles/listbox.module.css'

export const Controlled = () => {
  const collection = createListCollection({
    items: [
      { label: 'Small', value: 'sm' },
      { label: 'Medium', value: 'md' },
      { label: 'Large', value: 'lg' },
      { label: 'Extra Large', value: 'xl' },
    ],
  })
  const [value, setValue] = createSignal(['md'])

  return (
    <Listbox.Root class={styles.Root} collection={collection} value={value()} onValueChange={(e) => setValue(e.value)}>
      <Listbox.Label class={styles.Label}>Select Size</Listbox.Label>
      <Listbox.Content class={styles.Content}>
        <Index each={collection.items}>
          {(item) => (
            <Listbox.Item class={styles.Item} item={item()}>
              <Listbox.ItemText class={styles.ItemText}>{item().label}</Listbox.ItemText>
              <Listbox.ItemIndicator class={styles.ItemIndicator}>
                <CheckIcon />
              </Listbox.ItemIndicator>
            </Listbox.Item>
          )}
        </Index>
      </Listbox.Content>
    </Listbox.Root>
  )
}

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Listbox, createListCollection } from '@ark-ui/vue/listbox'
import { CheckIcon } from 'lucide-vue-next'
import { ref } from 'vue'
import styles from 'styles/listbox.module.css'

const collection = createListCollection({
  items: [
    { label: 'Small', value: 'sm' },
    { label: 'Medium', value: 'md' },
    { label: 'Large', value: 'lg' },
    { label: 'Extra Large', value: 'xl' },
  ],
})

const value = ref(['md'])
</script>

<template>
  <Listbox.Root :class="styles.Root" :collection="collection" v-model="value">
    <Listbox.Label :class="styles.Label">Select Size</Listbox.Label>
    <Listbox.Content :class="styles.Content">
      <Listbox.Item v-for="item in collection.items" :key="item.value" :class="styles.Item" :item="item">
        <Listbox.ItemText :class="styles.ItemText">{{ item.label }}</Listbox.ItemText>
        <Listbox.ItemIndicator :class="styles.ItemIndicator">
          <CheckIcon />
        </Listbox.ItemIndicator>
      </Listbox.Item>
    </Listbox.Content>
  </Listbox.Root>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Listbox, createListCollection } from '@ark-ui/svelte/listbox'
  import CheckIcon from 'lucide-svelte/icons/check'
  import styles from 'styles/listbox.module.css'

  const collection = createListCollection({
    items: [
      { label: 'Small', value: 'sm' },
      { label: 'Medium', value: 'md' },
      { label: 'Large', value: 'lg' },
      { label: 'Extra Large', value: 'xl' },
    ],
  })

  let value = $state(['md'])
</script>

<Listbox.Root class={styles.Root} {collection} {value} onValueChange={(e) => (value = e.value)}>
  <Listbox.Label class={styles.Label}>Select Size</Listbox.Label>
  <Listbox.Content class={styles.Content}>
    {#each collection.items as item (item.value)}
      <Listbox.Item class={styles.Item} {item}>
        <Listbox.ItemText class={styles.ItemText}>{item.label}</Listbox.ItemText>
        <Listbox.ItemIndicator class={styles.ItemIndicator}>
          <CheckIcon />
        </Listbox.ItemIndicator>
      </Listbox.Item>
    {/each}
  </Listbox.Content>
</Listbox.Root>

```

### Root Provider

An alternative way to control the listbox is to use the `RootProvider` component and the `useListbox` hook. This way you
can access the state and methods from outside the component.

**Example: root-provider**

#### React

```tsx
import { Listbox, createListCollection, useListbox } from '@ark-ui/react/listbox'
import { CheckIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/listbox.module.css'

export const RootProvider = () => {
  const collection = createListCollection({
    items: [
      { label: 'Low', value: 'low' },
      { label: 'Medium', value: 'medium' },
      { label: 'High', value: 'high' },
      { label: 'Critical', value: 'critical' },
    ],
  })
  const listbox = useListbox({ collection })

  return (
    <div className="stack">
      <button className={button.Root} onClick={() => listbox.setValue(['high'])}>
        Set to High
      </button>
      <Listbox.RootProvider className={styles.Root} value={listbox}>
        <Listbox.Label className={styles.Label}>Select Priority</Listbox.Label>
        <Listbox.Content className={styles.Content}>
          {collection.items.map((item) => (
            <Listbox.Item className={styles.Item} key={item.value} item={item}>
              <Listbox.ItemText className={styles.ItemText}>{item.label}</Listbox.ItemText>
              <Listbox.ItemIndicator className={styles.ItemIndicator}>
                <CheckIcon />
              </Listbox.ItemIndicator>
            </Listbox.Item>
          ))}
        </Listbox.Content>
      </Listbox.RootProvider>
    </div>
  )
}

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Listbox, createListCollection, useListbox } from '@ark-ui/solid/listbox'
import { CheckIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { Index } from 'solid-js'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/listbox.module.css'

export const RootProvider = () => {
  const collection = createListCollection({
    items: [
      { label: 'Low', value: 'low' },
      { label: 'Medium', value: 'medium' },
      { label: 'High', value: 'high' },
      { label: 'Critical', value: 'critical' },
    ],
  })
  const listbox = useListbox({ collection })

  return (
    <div class="stack">
      <button class={button.Root} onClick={() => listbox().setValue(['high'])}>
        Set to High
      </button>
      <Listbox.RootProvider class={styles.Root} value={listbox}>
        <Listbox.Label class={styles.Label}>Select Priority</Listbox.Label>
        <Listbox.Content class={styles.Content}>
          <Index each={collection.items}>
            {(item) => (
              <Listbox.Item class={styles.Item} item={item()}>
                <Listbox.ItemText class={styles.ItemText}>{item().label}</Listbox.ItemText>
                <Listbox.ItemIndicator class={styles.ItemIndicator}>
                  <CheckIcon />
                </Listbox.ItemIndicator>
              </Listbox.Item>
            )}
          </Index>
        </Listbox.Content>
      </Listbox.RootProvider>
    </div>
  )
}

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Listbox, createListCollection, useListbox } from '@ark-ui/vue/listbox'
import { CheckIcon } from 'lucide-vue-next'
import { computed } from 'vue'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/listbox.module.css'

const collection = createListCollection({
  items: [
    { label: 'Low', value: 'low' },
    { label: 'Medium', value: 'medium' },
    { label: 'High', value: 'high' },
    { label: 'Critical', value: 'critical' },
  ],
})

const listboxValue = useListbox({ collection })
const listbox = computed(() => listboxValue.value)
</script>

<template>
  <div class="stack">
    <button :class="button.Root" @click="listbox.setValue(['high'])">Set to High</button>
    <Listbox.RootProvider :class="styles.Root" :value="listbox">
      <Listbox.Label :class="styles.Label">Select Priority</Listbox.Label>
      <Listbox.Content :class="styles.Content">
        <Listbox.Item v-for="item in collection.items" :key="item.value" :class="styles.Item" :item="item">
          <Listbox.ItemText :class="styles.ItemText">{{ item.label }}</Listbox.ItemText>
          <Listbox.ItemIndicator :class="styles.ItemIndicator">
            <CheckIcon />
          </Listbox.ItemIndicator>
        </Listbox.Item>
      </Listbox.Content>
    </Listbox.RootProvider>
  </div>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Listbox, createListCollection, useListbox } from '@ark-ui/svelte/listbox'
  import CheckIcon from 'lucide-svelte/icons/check'
  import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
  import styles from 'styles/listbox.module.css'

  const collection = createListCollection({
    items: [
      { label: 'Low', value: 'low' },
      { label: 'Medium', value: 'medium' },
      { label: 'High', value: 'high' },
      { label: 'Critical', value: 'critical' },
    ],
  })

  const listbox = useListbox({ collection })
</script>

<div class="stack">
  <button class={button.Root} onclick={() => listbox().setValue(['high'])}>Set to High</button>
  <Listbox.RootProvider class={styles.Root} value={listbox}>
    <Listbox.Label class={styles.Label}>Select Priority</Listbox.Label>
    <Listbox.Content class={styles.Content}>
      {#each collection.items as item (item.value)}
        <Listbox.Item class={styles.Item} {item}>

        </Listbox.Item>
      {/each}
    </Listbox.Content>
  </Listbox.RootProvider>
</div>

```

### Disabled Item

Listbox items can be disabled using the `disabled` prop on the collection item.

**Example: disabled-item**

#### React

```tsx
import { Listbox, createListCollection } from '@ark-ui/react/listbox'
import { CheckIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import styles from 'styles/listbox.module.css'

export const DisabledItem = () => {
  const collection = createListCollection({
    items: [
      { label: 'Free', value: 'free' },
      { label: 'Pro', value: 'pro' },
      { label: 'Enterprise', value: 'enterprise', disabled: true },
      { label: 'Custom', value: 'custom' },
    ],
  })

            <Listbox.ItemIndicator className={styles.ItemIndicator}>
              <CheckIcon />
            </Listbox.ItemIndicator>
          </Listbox.Item>
        ))}
      </Listbox.Content>
    </Listbox.Root>
  )
}

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Listbox, createListCollection } from '@ark-ui/solid/listbox'
import { CheckIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { Index } from 'solid-js'
import styles from 'styles/listbox.module.css'

export const DisabledItem = () => {
  const collection = createListCollection({
    items: [
      { label: 'Free', value: 'free' },
      { label: 'Pro', value: 'pro' },
      { label: 'Enterprise', value: 'enterprise', disabled: true },
      { label: 'Custom', value: 'custom' },
    ],
  })

  return (
    <Listbox.Root class={styles.Root} collection={collection}>

              <Listbox.ItemText class={styles.ItemText}>{item().label}</Listbox.ItemText>
              <Listbox.ItemIndicator class={styles.ItemIndicator}>
                <CheckIcon />
              </Listbox.ItemIndicator>
            </Listbox.Item>
          )}
        </Index>
      </Listbox.Content>
    </Listbox.Root>
  )
}

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Listbox, createListCollection } from '@ark-ui/vue/listbox'
import { CheckIcon } from 'lucide-vue-next'
import styles from 'styles/listbox.module.css'

const collection = createListCollection({

    { label: 'Pro', value: 'pro' },
    { label: 'Enterprise', value: 'enterprise', disabled: true },
    { label: 'Custom', value: 'custom' },
  ],
})
</script>

<template>
  <Listbox.Root :class="styles.Root" :collection="collection">
    <Listbox.Label :class="styles.Label">Select Plan</Listbox.Label>
    <Listbox.Content :class="styles.Content">
      <Listbox.Item v-for="item in collection.items" :key="item.value" :class="styles.Item" :item="item">
        <Listbox.ItemText :class="styles.ItemText">{{ item.label }}</Listbox.ItemText>

        </Listbox.ItemIndicator>
      </Listbox.Item>
    </Listbox.Content>
  </Listbox.Root>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Listbox, createListCollection } from '@ark-ui/svelte/listbox'
  import CheckIcon from 'lucide-svelte/icons/check'
  import styles from 'styles/listbox.module.css'

  const collection = createListCollection({
    items: [
      { label: 'Free', value: 'free' },
      { label: 'Pro', value: 'pro' },
      { label: 'Enterprise', value: 'enterprise', disabled: true },
      { label: 'Custom', value: 'custom' },

<Listbox.Root class={styles.Root} {collection}>
  <Listbox.Label class={styles.Label}>Select Plan</Listbox.Label>
  <Listbox.Content class={styles.Content}>
    {#each collection.items as item (item.value)}
      <Listbox.Item class={styles.Item} {item}>
        <Listbox.ItemText class={styles.ItemText}>{item.label}</Listbox.ItemText>
        <Listbox.ItemIndicator class={styles.ItemIndicator}>

        </Listbox.ItemIndicator>
      </Listbox.Item>
    {/each}
  </Listbox.Content>
</Listbox.Root>

```

> You can also use the `isItemDisabled` within the `createListCollection` to disable items based on a condition.

### Multiple

You can set the `selectionMode` property as `multiple` to allow the user to select multiple items at a time.

**Example: multiple**

#### React

```tsx
import { Listbox, createListCollection } from '@ark-ui/react/listbox'
import { CheckIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import styles from 'styles/listbox.module.css'

export const Multiple = () => {
  const collection = createListCollection({
    items: [
      { label: 'Monday', value: 'mon' },
      { label: 'Tuesday', value: 'tue' },
      { label: 'Wednesday', value: 'wed' },
      { label: 'Thursday', value: 'thu' },
      { label: 'Friday', value: 'fri' },
      { label: 'Saturday', value: 'sat' },
      { label: 'Sunday', value: 'sun' },
    ],
  })

  return (
    <Listbox.Root className={styles.Root} collection={collection} selectionMode="multiple">
      <Listbox.Label className={styles.Label}>Select Days</Listbox.Label>
      <Listbox.Content className={styles.Content}>
        {collection.items.map((item) => (
          <Listbox.Item className={styles.Item} key={item.value} item={item}>
            <Listbox.ItemText className={styles.ItemText}>{item.label}</Listbox.ItemText>
            <Listbox.ItemIndicator className={styles.ItemIndicator}>
              <CheckIcon />
            </Listbox.ItemIndicator>
          </Listbox.Item>
        ))}
      </Listbox.Content>
    </Listbox.Root>
  )
}

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Listbox, createListCollection } from '@ark-ui/solid/listbox'
import { CheckIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { Index } from 'solid-js'
import styles from 'styles/listbox.module.css'

export const Multiple = () => {
  const collection = createListCollection({
    items: [
      { label: 'Monday', value: 'mon' },
      { label: 'Tuesday', value: 'tue' },
      { label: 'Wednesday', value: 'wed' },
      { label: 'Thursday', value: 'thu' },
      { label: 'Friday', value: 'fri' },
      { label: 'Saturday', value: 'sat' },
      { label: 'Sunday', value: 'sun' },
    ],
  })

  return (
    <Listbox.Root class={styles.Root} collection={collection} selectionMode="multiple">
      <Listbox.Label class={styles.Label}>Select Days</Listbox.Label>
      <Listbox.Content class={styles.Content}>
        <Index each={collection.items}>
          {(item) => (
            <Listbox.Item class={styles.Item} item={item()}>
              <Listbox.ItemText class={styles.ItemText}>{item().label}</Listbox.ItemText>
              <Listbox.ItemIndicator class={styles.ItemIndicator}>
                <CheckIcon />
              </Listbox.ItemIndicator>
            </Listbox.Item>
          )}
        </Index>
      </Listbox.Content>
    </Listbox.Root>
  )
}

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Listbox, createListCollection } from '@ark-ui/vue/listbox'
import { CheckIcon } from 'lucide-vue-next'
import styles from 'styles/listbox.module.css'

  ],
})
</script>

<template>
  <Listbox.Root :class="styles.Root" :collection="collection" selectionMode="multiple">
    <Listbox.Label :class="styles.Label">Select Days</Listbox.Label>
    <Listbox.Content :class="styles.Content">
      <Listbox.Item v-for="item in collection.items" :key="item.value" :class="styles.Item" :item="item">

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Listbox, createListCollection } from '@ark-ui/svelte/listbox'
  import CheckIcon from 'lucide-svelte/icons/check'

<Listbox.Root class={styles.Root} {collection} selectionMode="multiple">
  <Listbox.Label class={styles.Label}>Select Days</Listbox.Label>
  <Listbox.Content class={styles.Content}>
    {#each collection.items as item (item.value)}
      <Listbox.Item class={styles.Item} {item}>
        <Listbox.ItemText class={styles.ItemText}>{item.label}</Listbox.ItemText>
        <Listbox.ItemIndicator class={styles.ItemIndicator}>

        </Listbox.ItemIndicator>
      </Listbox.Item>
    {/each}
  </Listbox.Content>
</Listbox.Root>

```

### Grouping

The Listbox component supports grouping items. You can use the `groupBy` function to group items based on a specific
property.

**Example: group**

#### React

```tsx
import { Listbox, createListCollection } from '@ark-ui/react/listbox'
import { CheckIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import styles from 'styles/listbox.module.css'

export const Group = () => {
  const collection = createListCollection({
    items: [
      { label: 'New York', value: 'nyc', region: 'North America' },
      { label: 'Los Angeles', value: 'lax', region: 'North America' },
      { label: 'Toronto', value: 'yyz', region: 'North America' },
      { label: 'London', value: 'lhr', region: 'Europe' },
      { label: 'Paris', value: 'cdg', region: 'Europe' },
      { label: 'Berlin', value: 'ber', region: 'Europe' },
      { label: 'Tokyo', value: 'nrt', region: 'Asia Pacific' },
      { label: 'Singapore', value: 'sin', region: 'Asia Pacific' },
      { label: 'Sydney', value: 'syd', region: 'Asia Pacific' },
    ],
    groupBy: (item) => item.region,
  })

  return (
    <Listbox.Root className={styles.Root} collection={collection}>
      <Listbox.Label className={styles.Label}>Select Region</Listbox.Label>
      <Listbox.Content className={styles.Content}>
        {collection.group().map(([region, items]) => (
          <Listbox.ItemGroup className={styles.ItemGroup} key={region}>
            <Listbox.ItemGroupLabel className={styles.ItemGroupLabel}>{region}</Listbox.ItemGroupLabel>
            {items.map((item) => (
              <Listbox.Item className={styles.Item} key={item.value} item={item}>
                <Listbox.ItemText className={styles.ItemText}>{item.label}</Listbox.ItemText>
                <Listbox.ItemIndicator className={styles.ItemIndicator}>
                  <CheckIcon />
                </Listbox.ItemIndicator>
              </Listbox.Item>
            ))}
          </Listbox.ItemGroup>
        ))}
      </Listbox.Content>
    </Listbox.Root>
  )
}

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Listbox, createListCollection } from '@ark-ui/solid/listbox'

### Extended Selection

The extended selection mode allows users to select multiple items using keyboard modifiers like `Cmd` (Mac) or `Ctrl`
(Windows/Linux).

**Example: extended-select**

#### React

```tsx
import { Listbox, createListCollection } from '@ark-ui/react/listbox'
import { CheckIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import styles from 'styles/listbox.module.css'

export const ExtendedSelect = () => {
  const collection = createListCollection({
    items: [
      { label: 'React', value: 'react' },
      { label: 'Vue', value: 'vue' },
      { label: 'Angular', value: 'angular' },
      { label: 'Svelte', value: 'svelte' },
      { label: 'Solid', value: 'solid' },
      { label: 'Preact', value: 'preact' },
    ],
  })

  return (
    <Listbox.Root className={styles.Root} collection={collection} selectionMode="extended">
      <Listbox.Label className={styles.Label}>
        Hold <kbd>⌘</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> to select multiple
      </Listbox.Label>
      <Listbox.Content className={styles.Content}>
        {collection.items.map((item) => (
          <Listbox.Item className={styles.Item} key={item.value} item={item}>
            <Listbox.ItemText className={styles.ItemText}>{item.label}</Listbox.ItemText>
            <Listbox.ItemIndicator className={styles.ItemIndicator}>
              <CheckIcon />
            </Listbox.ItemIndicator>
          </Listbox.Item>
        ))}
      </Listbox.Content>
    </Listbox.Root>
  )
}

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Listbox, createListCollection } from '@ark-ui/solid/listbox'
import { CheckIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { Index } from 'solid-js'
import styles from 'styles/listbox.module.css'

      </Listbox.Label>
      <Listbox.Content class={styles.Content}>
        <Index each={collection.items}>
          {(item) => (
            <Listbox.Item class={styles.Item} item={item()}>
              <Listbox.ItemText class={styles.ItemText}>{item().label}</Listbox.ItemText>
              <Listbox.ItemIndicator class={styles.ItemIndicator}>

        <Listbox.ItemText :class="styles.ItemText">{{ item.label }}</Listbox.ItemText>
        <Listbox.ItemIndicator :class="styles.ItemIndicator">
          <CheckIcon />
        </Listbox.ItemIndicator>
      </Listbox.Item>
    </Listbox.Content>
  </Listbox.Root>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Listbox, createListCollection } from '@ark-ui/svelte/listbox'
  import CheckIcon from 'lucide-svelte/icons/check'
  import styles from 'styles/listbox.module.css'

  const collection = createListCollection({
    items: [
      { label: 'React', value: 'react' },
      { label: 'Vue', value: 'vue' },
      { label: 'Angular', value: 'angular' },
      { label: 'Svelte', value: 'svelte' },
      { label: 'Solid', value: 'solid' },
      { label: 'Preact', value: 'preact' },
    ],
  })
</script>

<Listbox.Root class={styles.Root} {collection} selectionMode="extended">
  <Listbox.Label class={styles.Label}>

### Horizontal

Use the `orientation` prop to display the listbox items horizontally.

**Example: horizontal**

#### React

```tsx
import { Listbox, createListCollection } from '@ark-ui/react/listbox'
import { CheckIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import styles from 'styles/listbox.module.css'

export const Horizontal = () => {
  const collection = createListCollection({
    items: [

        title: 'Midnight Dreams',
        artist: 'Luna Ray',
        image: 'https://picsum.photos/seed/album1/300/300',
      },
      {
        title: 'Neon Skyline',
        artist: 'The Electric',
        image: 'https://picsum.photos/seed/album2/300/300',
      },
      {
        title: 'Acoustic Sessions',
        artist: 'Sarah Woods',

        artist: 'Coastal Waves',
        image: 'https://picsum.photos/seed/album5/300/300',
      },
    ],
    itemToValue: (item) => item.title,
    itemToString: (item) => item.title,
  })

  return (
    <Listbox.Root className={styles.Root} collection={collection} orientation="horizontal">
      <Listbox.Label className={styles.Label}>Select Album</Listbox.Label>
      <Listbox.Content className={styles.Content}>
        {collection.items.map((item) => (
          <Listbox.Item className={styles.ItemCard} key={item.title} item={item}>

### Grid Layout

Use `createGridCollection` to display items in a grid layout with keyboard navigation support.

**Example: grid**

#### React

```tsx
import { createGridCollection } from '@ark-ui/react/collection'
import { Listbox } from '@ark-ui/react/listbox'
import styles from 'styles/listbox.module.css'

export const Grid = () => {
  const collection = createGridCollection({
    items: [
      { label: '😀', value: 'grinning' },
      { label: '😍', value: 'heart-eyes' },
      { label: '🥳', value: 'partying' },
      { label: '😎', value: 'sunglasses' },
      { label: '🤩', value: 'star-struck' },
      { label: '😂', value: 'joy' },
      { label: '🥰', value: 'smiling-hearts' },
      { label: '😊', value: 'blush' },
      { label: '🤗', value: 'hugging' },
      { label: '😇', value: 'innocent' },
      { label: '🔥', value: 'fire' },
      { label: '✨', value: 'sparkles' },
      { label: '💯', value: 'hundred' },
      { label: '🎉', value: 'tada' },
      { label: '❤️', value: 'heart' },
      { label: '👍', value: 'thumbs-up' },
      { label: '👏', value: 'clap' },
      { label: '🚀', value: 'rocket' },
      { label: '⭐', value: 'star' },
      { label: '🌈', value: 'rainbow' },
    ],
    columnCount: 5,
  })

  return (
    <Listbox.Root className={styles.Root} collection={collection}>
      <Listbox.Label className={styles.Label}>Pick a reaction</Listbox.Label>
      <Listbox.Content className={styles.GridContent}>
        {collection.items.map((item) => (
          <Listbox.Item className={styles.GridItem} key={item.value} item={item}>
            <Listbox.ItemText>{item.label}</Listbox.ItemText>
          </Listbox.Item>
        ))}
      </Listbox.Content>
    </Listbox.Root>
  )
}

```

#### Solid

          {(item) => (
            <Listbox.Item class={styles.GridItem} item={item()}>
              <Listbox.ItemText>{item().label}</Listbox.ItemText>
            </Listbox.Item>

### Filtering

Use `useListCollection` with the `filter` function to enable filtering of items.

**Example: filtering**

#### React

```tsx
import { useListCollection } from '@ark-ui/react/collection'
import { Listbox } from '@ark-ui/react/listbox'
import { CheckIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import field from 'styles/field.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/listbox.module.css'

export const Filtering = () => {
  const { collection, filter } = useListCollection({
    initialItems: [
      { label: 'React', value: 'react' },
      { label: 'Vue', value: 'vue' },
      { label: 'Angular', value: 'angular' },
      { label: 'Svelte', value: 'svelte' },
      { label: 'Solid', value: 'solid' },
      { label: 'Next.js', value: 'nextjs' },
      { label: 'Nuxt.js', value: 'nuxtjs' },
      { label: 'Remix', value: 'remix' },
      { label: 'Gatsby', value: 'gatsby' },
      { label: 'Preact', value: 'preact' },
    ],
    filter: (itemText, filterText) => itemText.toLowerCase().includes(filterText.toLowerCase()),
  })

  return (
    <Listbox.Root className={styles.Root} collection={collection}>
      <Listbox.Label className={styles.Label}>Select Framework</Listbox.Label>
      <Listbox.Input
        className={field.Input}
        placeholder="Search frameworks..."

### Select All

Use `useListboxContext` to implement a "Select All" functionality that allows users to select or deselect all items at
once.

**Example: select-all**

#### React

```tsx
import { Listbox, createListCollection, useListboxContext } from '@ark-ui/react/listbox'
import { CheckIcon, MinusIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import styles from 'styles/listbox.module.css'

const frameworks = createListCollection({
  items: [
    { label: 'React', value: 'react' },
    { label: 'Vue', value: 'vue' },
    { label: 'Angular', value: 'angular' },
    { label: 'Svelte', value: 'svelte' },
    { label: 'Next.js', value: 'nextjs' },
    { label: 'Nuxt.js', value: 'nuxtjs' },
    { label: 'Remix', value: 'remix' },
    { label: 'Gatsby', value: 'gatsby' },
  ],
})

const SelectAllHeader = () => {
  const listbox = useListboxContext()
  const isAllSelected = listbox.value.length === frameworks.items.length
  const isSomeSelected = listbox.value.length > 0 && listbox.value.length < frameworks.items.length

  const handleSelectAll = () => {
    if (isAllSelected) {
      listbox.setValue([])
    } else {
      listbox.setValue(frameworks.items.map((item) => item.value))
    }
  }

  return (
    <button className={styles.SelectAllHeader} type="button" onClick={handleSelectAll}>
      <span className={styles.SelectAllHeaderIndicator}>
        {isAllSelected ? <CheckIcon /> : isSomeSelected ? <MinusIcon /> : null}
      </span>
      <span className={styles.Label}>Select All</span>
    </button>
  )
}

export const SelectAll = () => {
  return (
    <Listbox.Root className={styles.Root} collection={frameworks} selectionMode="multiple">
      <SelectAllHeader />
      <Listbox.Content className={styles.Content}>
        {frameworks.items.map((item) => (
          <Listbox.Item className={styles.Item} key={item.value} item={item}>
            <Listbox.ItemText className={styles.ItemText}>{item.label}</Listbox.ItemText>
            <Listbox.ItemIndicator className={styles.ItemIndicator}>
              <CheckIcon />
            </Listbox.ItemIndicator>

import { CheckIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import styles from 'styles/listbox.module.css'

export const ValueText = () => {

    items: [
      { label: 'Red', value: 'red' },
      { label: 'Blue', value: 'blue' },
      { label: 'Green', value: 'green' },
      { label: 'Yellow', value: 'yellow' },
      { label: 'Purple', value: 'purple' },
    ],
  })

  return (
    <Listbox.Root
      className={styles.Root}
      collection={collection}
      selectionMode="multiple"
      defaultValue={['red', 'blue']}
    >
      <Listbox.Label className={styles.Label}>
        Colors: <Listbox.ValueText className={styles.ValueText} />
      </Listbox.Label>
      <Listbox.Content className={styles.Content}>
        {collection.items.map((item) => (
          <Listbox.Item className={styles.Item} key={item.value} item={item}>
            <Listbox.ItemText className={styles.ItemText}>{item.label}</Listbox.ItemText>
            <Listbox.ItemIndicator className={styles.ItemIndicator}>
              <CheckIcon />

## Guides

### Type Safety

The `Listbox.RootComponent` type enables you to create typed wrapper components that maintain full type safety for
collection items.

```tsx
const Listbox: ArkListbox.RootComponent = (props) => {
  return <ArkListbox.Root {...props}>{/* ... */}</ArkListbox.Root>
}
```

Use the wrapper with full type inference on `onValueChange` and other callbacks:

```tsx
const App = () => {
  const collection = createListCollection({
    initialItems: [
      { label: 'React', value: 'react' },
      { label: 'Vue', value: 'vue' },
    ],
  })
  return (
    <Listbox
      collection={collection}
      onValueChange={(e) => {
        // e.items is typed as Array<{ label: string, value: string }>
        console.log(e.items)
      }}
    >
      {/* ... */}
    </Listbox>
  )
}
```

## API Reference

### Props

**Component API Reference**

#### React

**Root Props:**

| Prop | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| `collection` | `ListCollection<T>` | Yes | The collection of items |
| `asChild` | `boolean` | No | Use the provided child element as the default rendered element, combining their props and behavior. |
| `defaultHighlightedValue` | `string` | No | The initial value of the highlighted item when opened.
Use when you don't need to control the highlighted value of the listbox. |
| `defaultValue` | `string[]` | No | The initial default value of the listbox when rendered.
Use when you don't need to control the value of the listbox. |
| `deselectable` | `boolean` | No | Whether to disallow empty selection |
| `disabled` | `boolean` | No | Whether the listbox is disabled |
| `disallowSelectAll` | `boolean` | No | Whether to disallow selecting all items when `meta+a` is pressed |
| `highlightedValue` | `string` | No | The controlled key of the highlighted item |
| `id` | `string` | No | The unique identifier of the machine. |
| `ids` | `Partial<{
  root: string
  content: string
  label: string
  item: (id: string | number) => string
  itemGroup: (id: string | number) => string
  itemGroupLabel: (id: string | number) => string
}>` | No | The ids of the elements in the listbox. Useful for composition. |
| `loopFocus` | `boolean` | No | Whether to loop the keyboard navigation through the options |
| `onHighlightChange` | `(details: HighlightChangeDetails<T>) => void` | No | The callback fired when the highlighted item changes. |
| `onSelect` | `(details: SelectionDetails) => void` | No | Function called when an item is selected |
| `onValueChange` | `(details: ValueChangeDetails<T>) => void` | No | The callback fired when the selected item changes. |

# Marquee



## Anatomy

{/*  */}

```tsx
<Marquee.Root>
  <Marquee.Edge />
  <Marquee.Viewport>
    <Marquee.Content>
      <Marquee.Item />
    </Marquee.Content>
  </Marquee.Viewport>
</Marquee.Root>
```

## Examples

**Example: basic**

#### React

```tsx
import { Marquee } from '@ark-ui/react/marquee'
import styles from 'styles/marquee.module.css'

const items = [
  { name: 'Apple', logo: '🍎' },
  { name: 'Banana', logo: '🍌' },
  { name: 'Cherry', logo: '🍒' },
  { name: 'Grape', logo: '🍇' },

    <Marquee.Viewport class={styles.Viewport}>
      <Marquee.Content class={styles.Content}>
        <For each={items}>
          {(item) => (
            <Marquee.Item class={styles.Item}>
              <span class={styles.ItemLogo}>{item.logo}</span>

      </Marquee.Content>
    </Marquee.Viewport>
  </Marquee.Root>
)

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Marquee } from '@ark-ui/vue/marquee'
import styles from 'styles/marquee.module.css'

const items = [
  { name: 'Apple', logo: '🍎' },
  { name: 'Banana', logo: '🍌' },
  { name: 'Cherry', logo: '🍒' },
  { name: 'Grape', logo: '🍇' },
  { name: 'Watermelon', logo: '🍉' },
  { name: 'Strawberry', logo: '🍓' },
]
</script>

<template>
  <Marquee.Root :class="styles.Root">
    <Marquee.Viewport :class="styles.Viewport">
      <Marquee.Content :class="styles.Content">
        <Marquee.Item v-for="item in items" :key="item.name" :class="styles.Item">
          <span :class="styles.ItemLogo">{{ item.logo }}</span>
          <span :class="styles.ItemName">{{ item.name }}</span>

          <span class={styles.ItemName}>{item.name}</span>
        </Marquee.Item>
      {/each}
    </Marquee.Content>
  </Marquee.Viewport>
</Marquee.Root>

```

### Auto Fill

Use the `autoFill` prop to automatically duplicate content to fill the viewport. The `spacing` prop controls the gap
between duplicated content instances:

**Example: auto-fill**

#### React

```tsx
import { Marquee } from '@ark-ui/react/marquee'
import styles from 'styles/marquee.module.css'

const items = [
  { name: 'Apple', logo: '🍎' },
  { name: 'Banana', logo: '🍌' },
  { name: 'Cherry', logo: '🍒' },
]

export const AutoFill = () => (
  <Marquee.Root autoFill spacing="2rem" className={styles.Root}>
    <Marquee.Viewport className={styles.Viewport}>
      <Marquee.Content className={styles.Content}>
        {items.map((item, i) => (
          <Marquee.Item key={i} className={styles.Item}>
            <span className={styles.ItemLogo}>{item.logo}</span>
            <span className={styles.ItemName}>{item.name}</span>
          </Marquee.Item>
        ))}
      </Marquee.Content>
    </Marquee.Viewport>
  </Marquee.Root>
)

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { For } from 'solid-js'
import { Marquee } from '@ark-ui/solid/marquee'
import styles from 'styles/marquee.module.css'

const items = [
  { name: 'Apple', logo: '🍎' },
  { name: 'Banana', logo: '🍌' },
  { name: 'Cherry', logo: '🍒' },
]

export const AutoFill = () => (
  <Marquee.Root autoFill spacing="2rem" class={styles.Root}>
    <Marquee.Viewport class={styles.Viewport}>
      <Marquee.Content class={styles.Content}>
        <For each={items}>
          {(item) => (
            <Marquee.Item class={styles.Item}>
              <span class={styles.ItemLogo}>{item.logo}</span>
              <span class={styles.ItemName}>{item.name}</span>
            </Marquee.Item>
          )}
        </For>
      </Marquee.Content>
    </Marquee.Viewport>
  </Marquee.Root>
)

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Marquee } from '@ark-ui/vue/marquee'
import styles from 'styles/marquee.module.css'

const items = [
  { name: 'Apple', logo: '🍎' },
  { name: 'Banana', logo: '🍌' },
  { name: 'Cherry', logo: '🍒' },
]
</script>

<template>
  <Marquee.Root auto-fill spacing="2rem" :class="styles.Root">
    <Marquee.Viewport :class="styles.Viewport">
      <Marquee.Content :class="styles.Content">
        <Marquee.Item v-for="item in items" :key="item.name" :class="styles.Item">
          <span :class="styles.ItemLogo">{{ item.logo }}</span>
          <span :class="styles.ItemName">{{ item.name }}</span>
        </Marquee.Item>
      </Marquee.Content>
    </Marquee.Viewport>
  </Marquee.Root>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Marquee } from '@ark-ui/svelte/marquee'
  import styles from 'styles/marquee.module.css'

  const items = [
    { name: 'Apple', logo: '🍎' },
    { name: 'Banana', logo: '🍌' },
    { name: 'Cherry', logo: '🍒' },
  ]
</script>

<Marquee.Root autoFill spacing="2rem" class={styles.Root}>
  <Marquee.Viewport class={styles.Viewport}>
    <Marquee.Content class={styles.Content}>
      {#each items as item}
        <Marquee.Item class={styles.Item}>
          <span class={styles.ItemLogo}>{item.logo}</span>
          <span class={styles.ItemName}>{item.name}</span>
        </Marquee.Item>
      {/each}
    </Marquee.Content>
  </Marquee.Viewport>
</Marquee.Root>

```

### Reverse

Set the `reverse` prop to reverse the scroll direction:

**Example: reverse**

#### React

```tsx
import { Marquee } from '@ark-ui/react/marquee'
import styles from 'styles/marquee.module.css'

const items = [
  { name: 'Apple', logo: '🍎' },
  { name: 'Banana', logo: '🍌' },
  { name: 'Cherry', logo: '🍒' },
  { name: 'Grape', logo: '🍇' },
  { name: 'Watermelon', logo: '🍉' },
  { name: 'Strawberry', logo: '🍓' },

export const Reverse = () => (
  <Marquee.Root reverse class={styles.Root}>
    <Marquee.Viewport class={styles.Viewport}>
      <Marquee.Content class={styles.Content}>
        <For each={items}>
          {(item) => (
            <Marquee.Item class={styles.Item}>
              <span class={styles.ItemLogo}>{item.logo}</span>
              <span class={styles.ItemName}>{item.name}</span>

### Speed

Control the animation speed using the `speed` prop, which accepts values in pixels per second:

**Example: speed**

#### React

```tsx
import { Marquee } from '@ark-ui/react/marquee'
import styles from 'styles/marquee.module.css'

const items = [
  { name: 'Apple', logo: '🍎' },
  { name: 'Banana', logo: '🍌' },
  { name: 'Cherry', logo: '🍒' },
  { name: 'Grape', logo: '🍇' },
  { name: 'Watermelon', logo: '🍉' },
  { name: 'Strawberry', logo: '🍓' },
]

export const Speed = () => (
  <div className="stack">
    <div>
      <h3>Slow (25px/s)</h3>
      <Marquee.Root speed={25} className={styles.Root}>
        <Marquee.Viewport className={styles.Viewport}>
          <Marquee.Content className={styles.Content}>

            ))}
          </Marquee.Content>
        </Marquee.Viewport>
      </Marquee.Root>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>Normal (50px/s)</h3>
      <Marquee.Root speed={50} className={styles.Root}>
        <Marquee.Viewport className={styles.Viewport}>
          <Marquee.Content className={styles.Content}>

### Pause on Interaction

Enable `pauseOnInteraction` to pause the marquee when users hover or focus on it, improving accessibility:

**Example: pause-on-interaction**

#### React

```tsx
import { Marquee } from '@ark-ui/react/marquee'
import styles from 'styles/marquee.module.css'

const items = [
  { name: 'Apple', logo: '🍎' },
  { name: 'Banana', logo: '🍌' },
  { name: 'Cherry', logo: '🍒' },
  { name: 'Grape', logo: '🍇' },
  { name: 'Watermelon', logo: '🍉' },
  { name: 'Strawberry', logo: '🍓' },
]

export const PauseOnInteraction = () => (
  <Marquee.Root pauseOnInteraction className={styles.Root}>
    <Marquee.Viewport className={styles.Viewport}>
      <Marquee.Content className={styles.Content}>
        {items.map((item, i) => (
          <Marquee.Item key={i} className={styles.Item}>
            <span className={styles.ItemLogo}>{item.logo}</span>
            <span className={styles.ItemName}>{item.name}</span>
          </Marquee.Item>
        ))}
      </Marquee.Content>
    </Marquee.Viewport>
  </Marquee.Root>
)

```

#### Solid

```tsx

  { name: 'Cherry', logo: '🍒' },
  { name: 'Grape', logo: '🍇' },

]

export const PauseOnInteraction = () => (
  <Marquee.Root pauseOnInteraction class={styles.Root}>
    <Marquee.Viewport class={styles.Viewport}>
      <Marquee.Content class={styles.Content}>
        <For each={items}>
          {(item) => (
            <Marquee.Item class={styles.Item}>
              <span class={styles.ItemLogo}>{item.logo}</span>

import styles from 'styles/marquee.module.css'

const items = [
  { name: 'Apple', logo: '🍎' },
  { name: 'Banana', logo: '🍌' },
  { name: 'Cherry', logo: '🍒' },

  ]
</script>

<Marquee.Root pauseOnInteraction class={styles.Root}>

    <Marquee.Content class={styles.Content}>
      {#each items as item}
        <Marquee.Item class={styles.Item}>

        </Marquee.Item>
      {/each}
    </Marquee.Content>

```

### Programmatic Control

Use the `useMarquee` hook with `Marquee.RootProvider` to access the marquee API and control playback programmatically:

**Example: programmatic-control**

#### React

```tsx
import { Marquee, useMarquee } from '@ark-ui/react/marquee'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/marquee.module.css'

const items = [
  { name: 'Apple', logo: '🍎' },
  { name: 'Banana', logo: '🍌' },
  { name: 'Cherry', logo: '🍒' },
  { name: 'Grape', logo: '🍇' },
  { name: 'Watermelon', logo: '🍉' },
  { name: 'Strawberry', logo: '🍓' },
]

export const ProgrammaticControl = () => {
  const marquee = useMarquee()

  return (
    <div className="stack">
      <Marquee.RootProvider value={marquee} className={styles.Root}>
        <Marquee.Viewport className={styles.Viewport}>
          <Marquee.Content className={styles.Content}>
            {items.map((item, i) => (
              <Marquee.Item key={i} className={styles.Item}>
                <span className={styles.ItemLogo}>{item.logo}</span>
                <span className={styles.ItemName}>{item.name}</span>
              </Marquee.Item>
            ))}
          </Marquee.Content>
        </Marquee.Viewport>
      </Marquee.RootProvider>

      <div className="hstack">
        <button className={button.Root} onClick={() => marquee.pause()}>
          Pause
        </button>
        <button className={button.Root} onClick={() => marquee.resume()}>
          Resume
        </button>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { For } from 'solid-js'
import { Marquee, useMarquee } from '@ark-ui/solid/marquee'

        <Marquee.Viewport class={styles.Viewport}>
          <Marquee.Content class={styles.Content}>
            <For each={items}>
              {(item) => (
                <Marquee.Item class={styles.Item}>
                  <span class={styles.ItemLogo}>{item.logo}</span>
                  <span class={styles.ItemName}>{item.name}</span>

    </div>
  )
}

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">

import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/marquee.module.css'

const items = [
  { name: 'Apple', logo: '🍎' },
  { name: 'Banana', logo: '🍌' },
  { name: 'Cherry', logo: '🍒' },
  { name: 'Grape', logo: '🍇' },
  { name: 'Watermelon', logo: '🍉' },
  { name: 'Strawberry', logo: '🍓' },
]

const marquee = useMarquee({})
</script>

<template>

    { name: 'Watermelon', logo: '🍉' },
    { name: 'Strawberry', logo: '🍓' },
  ]

  const id = $props.id()
  const marquee = useMarquee(() => ({ id }))
</script>

<div class="stack">
  <Marquee.RootProvider value={marquee} class={styles.Root}>
    <Marquee.Viewport class={styles.Viewport}>
      <Marquee.Content class={styles.Content}>
        {#each items as item}
          <Marquee.Item class={styles.Item}>
            <span class={styles.ItemLogo}>{item.logo}</span>

  <div class="hstack">
    <button class={button.Root} onclick={() => marquee().pause()}>Pause</button>
    <button class={button.Root} onclick={() => marquee().resume()}>Resume</button>
  </div>
</div>

```

> If you're using the `Marquee.RootProvider` component, you don't need to use the `Marquee.Root` component.

### Loops

Set the `loopCount` prop to run the marquee a specific number of times. Use `onLoopComplete` to track each loop
iteration and `onComplete` to know when all loops finish:

**Example: finite-loops**

#### React

```tsx
import { useState } from 'react'
import { Marquee } from '@ark-ui/react/marquee'
import styles from 'styles/marquee.module.css'

const items = [
  { name: 'Apple', logo: '🍎' },
  { name: 'Banana', logo: '🍌' },
  { name: 'Cherry', logo: '🍒' },
  { name: 'Grape', logo: '🍇' },
  { name: 'Watermelon', logo: '🍉' },
  { name: 'Strawberry', logo: '🍓' },
]

export const FiniteLoops = () => {
  const [loopCount, setLoopCount] = useState(0)
  const [completedCount, setCompletedCount] = useState(0)

  return (
    <div className="stack">
      <Marquee.Root
        loopCount={3}
        onLoopComplete={() => setLoopCount((prev) => prev + 1)}
        onComplete={() => setCompletedCount((prev) => prev + 1)}
        className={styles.Root}
      >
        <Marquee.Viewport className={styles.Viewport}>
          <Marquee.Content className={styles.Content}>
            {items.map((item, i) => (
              <Marquee.Item key={i} className={styles.Item}>
                <span className={styles.ItemLogo}>{item.logo}</span>
                <span className={styles.ItemName}>{item.name}</span>
              </Marquee.Item>
            ))}
          </Marquee.Content>
        </Marquee.Viewport>
      </Marquee.Root>

      <div>
        <p>Loop completed: {loopCount} times</p>
        <p>Animation completed: {completedCount} times</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { For, createSignal } from 'solid-js'
import { Marquee } from '@ark-ui/solid/marquee'
import styles from 'styles/marquee.module.css'

Add `Marquee.Edge` components to create fade effects at the start and end of the scrolling area:

**Example: with-edges**

  { name: 'Grape', logo: '🍇' },
  { name: 'Watermelon', logo: '🍉' },
  { name: 'Strawberry', logo: '🍓' },

export const WithEdges = () => (
  <Marquee.Root className={styles.Root}>
    <Marquee.Edge side="start" className={styles.Edge} />
    <Marquee.Viewport className={styles.Viewport}>
      <Marquee.Content className={styles.Content}>
        {items.map((item, i) => (
          <Marquee.Item key={i} className={styles.Item}>
            <span className={styles.ItemLogo}>{item.logo}</span>
            <span className={styles.ItemName}>{item.name}</span>
          </Marquee.Item>

## Guides

### Content Animation

The Marquee component requires CSS keyframe animations to function properly. You'll need to define animations for both
horizontal and vertical scrolling:

```css
@keyframes marqueeX {
  from {
    transform: translateX(0);
  }
  to {
    transform: translateX(var(--marquee-translate));
  }
}

@keyframes marqueeY {
  from {
    transform: translateY(0);
  }
  to {
    transform: translateY(var(--marquee-translate));
  }
}
```

The component automatically applies the appropriate animation (`marqueeX` or `marqueeY`) based on the scroll direction
and uses the `--marquee-translate` CSS variable for seamless looping.

You can target specific parts of the marquee using `data-part` attributes for custom styling:

- `[data-part="root"]` - The root container
- `[data-part="viewport"]` - The scrolling viewport
- `[data-part="content"]` - The content wrapper (receives animation)
- `[data-part="item"]` - Individual marquee items
- `[data-part="edge"]` - Edge gradient overlays

### Best Practices

- **Enable pause-on-interaction**: Use `pauseOnInteraction` to allow users to pause animations on hover or focus,
  improving accessibility and readability
- **Use descriptive labels**: Provide meaningful `aria-label` values that describe the marquee content (e.g., "Partner
  logos", "Latest announcements")
- **Avoid for critical information**: Don't use marquees for essential content that users must read, as continuously
  moving text can be difficult to process. Consider static displays for important information

</script>

<template>
  <Menu.Root>
    <Menu.Trigger :class="styles.Trigger">
      File
      <Menu.Indicator :class="styles.Indicator">
        <ChevronDownIcon />

### Item Selection

Use `onSelect` to handle item selection. The callback receives the item's `id`.

**Example: controlled**

#### React

```tsx
import { Menu } from '@ark-ui/react/menu'
import { ChevronDownIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import { useState } from 'react'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/menu.module.css'

export const Controlled = () => {
  const [open, setOpen] = useState(false)

  return (
    <div className="stack">
      <button type="button" className={button.Root} onClick={() => setOpen(!open)}>
        Toggle
      </button>
      <Menu.Root open={open} onOpenChange={(e) => setOpen(e.open)}>
        <Menu.Trigger className={styles.Trigger}>
          Actions
          <Menu.Indicator className={styles.Indicator}>
            <ChevronDownIcon />
          </Menu.Indicator>
        </Menu.Trigger>
        <Menu.Positioner>
          <Menu.Content className={styles.Content}>
            <Menu.Item className={styles.Item} value="edit">
              Edit
            </Menu.Item>
            <Menu.Item className={styles.Item} value="duplicate">
              Duplicate
            </Menu.Item>
            <Menu.Item className={styles.Item} value="archive">
              Archive
            </Menu.Item>
            <Menu.Item className={styles.Item} value="delete">
              Delete
            </Menu.Item>
          </Menu.Content>
        </Menu.Positioner>
      </Menu.Root>
    </div>
  )
}

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Menu } from '@ark-ui/solid/menu'
import { ChevronDownIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { createSignal } from 'solid-js'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/menu.module.css'

export const Controlled = () => {
  const [open, setOpen] = createSignal(false)

  return (
    <div class="stack">
      <button type="button" class={button.Root} onClick={() => setOpen(!open())}>
        Toggle
      </button>
      <Menu.Root open={open()} onOpenChange={(e) => setOpen(e.open)}>
        <Menu.Trigger class={styles.Trigger}>
          Actions
          <Menu.Indicator class={styles.Indicator}>
            <ChevronDownIcon />
          </Menu.Indicator>
        </Menu.Trigger>
        <Menu.Positioner>
          <Menu.Content class={styles.Content}>
            <Menu.Item class={styles.Item} value="edit">
              Edit
            </Menu.Item>
            <Menu.Item class={styles.Item} value="duplicate">
              Duplicate
            </Menu.Item>
            <Menu.Item class={styles.Item} value="archive">
              Archive
            </Menu.Item>
            <Menu.Item class={styles.Item} value="delete">
              Delete
            </Menu.Item>
          </Menu.Content>
        </Menu.Positioner>
      </Menu.Root>
    </div>
  )
}

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Menu } from '@ark-ui/vue/menu'
import { ChevronDownIcon } from 'lucide-vue-next'
import { ref } from 'vue'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/menu.module.css'

const open = ref(false)
</script>

<template>
  <div class="stack">
    <button type="button" :class="button.Root" @click="open = !open">Toggle</button>
    <Menu.Root v-model:open="open">
      <Menu.Trigger :class="styles.Trigger">
        Actions
        <Menu.Indicator :class="styles.Indicator">
          <ChevronDownIcon />
        </Menu.Indicator>
      </Menu.Trigger>
      <Menu.Positioner>
        <Menu.Content :class="styles.Content">
          <Menu.Item :class="styles.Item" value="edit">Edit</Menu.Item>
          <Menu.Item :class="styles.Item" value="duplicate">Duplicate</Menu.Item>
          <Menu.Item :class="styles.Item" value="archive">Archive</Menu.Item>
          <Menu.Item :class="styles.Item" value="delete">Delete</Menu.Item>
        </Menu.Content>
      </Menu.Positioner>
    </Menu.Root>
  </div>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Menu } from '@ark-ui/svelte/menu'
  import { ChevronDownIcon } from 'lucide-svelte'
  import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
  import styles from 'styles/menu.module.css'

  let open = $state(false)
</script>

<div class="stack">
  <button type="button" class={button.Root} onclick={() => (open = !open)}>Toggle</button>
  <Menu.Root bind:open>
    <Menu.Trigger class={styles.Trigger}>
      Actions
      <Menu.Indicator class={styles.Indicator}>
        <ChevronDownIcon />
      </Menu.Indicator>
    </Menu.Trigger>
    <Menu.Positioner>
      <Menu.Content class={styles.Content}>
        <Menu.Item class={styles.Item} value="edit">Edit</Menu.Item>
        <Menu.Item class={styles.Item} value="duplicate">Duplicate</Menu.Item>
        <Menu.Item class={styles.Item} value="archive">Archive</Menu.Item>
        <Menu.Item class={styles.Item} value="delete">Delete</Menu.Item>
      </Menu.Content>
    </Menu.Positioner>
  </Menu.Root>
</div>

```

### Root Provider

An alternative way to control the menu is to use the `RootProvider` component and the `useMenu` hook. This way you can
access the state and methods from outside the component.

**Example: root-provider**

#### React

```tsx
import { Menu, useMenu } from '@ark-ui/react/menu'
import { ChevronDownIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/menu.module.css'

export const RootProvider = () => {
  const menu = useMenu()

  return (
    <div className="stack">
      <button className={button.Root} onClick={() => menu.api.setHighlightedValue('copy')}>
        Highlight Copy
      </button>
      <Menu.RootProvider value={menu}>
        <Menu.Trigger className={styles.Trigger}>
          Edit
          <Menu.Indicator className={styles.Indicator}>
            <ChevronDownIcon />
          </Menu.Indicator>
        </Menu.Trigger>
        <Menu.Positioner>
          <Menu.Content className={styles.Content}>
            <Menu.Item className={styles.Item} value="cut">
              Cut
            </Menu.Item>
            <Menu.Item className={styles.Item} value="copy">
              Copy
            </Menu.Item>
            <Menu.Item className={styles.Item} value="paste">
              Paste
            </Menu.Item>
            <Menu.Item className={styles.Item} value="delete">
              Delete
            </Menu.Item>
          </Menu.Content>
        </Menu.Positioner>
      </Menu.RootProvider>
    </div>
  )
}

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Menu, useMenu } from '@ark-ui/solid/menu'
import { ChevronDownIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/menu.module.css'

export const RootProvider = () => {
  const menu = useMenu()

  return (
    <div class="stack">
      <button class={button.Root} onClick={() => menu.api().setHighlightedValue('copy')}>
        Highlight Copy
      </button>
      <Menu.RootProvider value={menu}>
        <Menu.Trigger class={styles.Trigger}>
          Edit
          <Menu.Indicator class={styles.Indicator}>
            <ChevronDownIcon />
          </Menu.Indicator>
        </Menu.Trigger>
        <Menu.Positioner>
          <Menu.Content class={styles.Content}>
            <Menu.Item class={styles.Item} value="cut">
              Cut
            </Menu.Item>
            <Menu.Item class={styles.Item} value="copy">
              Copy
            </Menu.Item>
            <Menu.Item class={styles.Item} value="paste">
              Paste
            </Menu.Item>
            <Menu.Item class={styles.Item} value="delete">
              Delete
            </Menu.Item>
          </Menu.Content>
        </Menu.Positioner>
      </Menu.RootProvider>
    </div>
  )
}

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Menu, useMenu } from '@ark-ui/vue/menu'
import { ChevronDownIcon } from 'lucide-vue-next'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/menu.module.css'

const menu = useMenu()
</script>

<template>
  <div class="stack">
    <button :class="button.Root" @click="menu.api.value.setHighlightedValue('copy')">Highlight Copy</button>
    <Menu.RootProvider :value="menu">
      <Menu.Trigger :class="styles.Trigger">
        Edit
        <Menu.Indicator :class="styles.Indicator">
          <ChevronDownIcon />
        </Menu.Indicator>
      </Menu.Trigger>
      <Menu.Positioner>
        <Menu.Content :class="styles.Content">
          <Menu.Item :class="styles.Item" value="cut">Cut</Menu.Item>
          <Menu.Item :class="styles.Item" value="copy">Copy</Menu.Item>
          <Menu.Item :class="styles.Item" value="paste">Paste</Menu.Item>
          <Menu.Item :class="styles.Item" value="delete">Delete</Menu.Item>
        </Menu.Content>
      </Menu.Positioner>
    </Menu.RootProvider>
  </div>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Menu, useMenu } from '@ark-ui/svelte/menu'
  import { ChevronDownIcon } from 'lucide-svelte'
  import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
  import styles from 'styles/menu.module.css'

  const menu = useMenu()
</script>

<div class="stack">
  <button class={button.Root} onclick={() => menu().api.setHighlightedValue('copy')}>Highlight Copy</button>
  <Menu.RootProvider value={menu}>
    <Menu.Trigger class={styles.Trigger}>
      Edit
      <Menu.Indicator class={styles.Indicator}>
        <ChevronDownIcon />
      </Menu.Indicator>
    </Menu.Trigger>
    <Menu.Positioner>
      <Menu.Content class={styles.Content}>
        <Menu.Item class={styles.Item} value="cut">Cut</Menu.Item>
        <Menu.Item class={styles.Item} value="copy">Copy</Menu.Item>
        <Menu.Item class={styles.Item} value="paste">Paste</Menu.Item>
        <Menu.Item class={styles.Item} value="delete">Delete</Menu.Item>
      </Menu.Content>
    </Menu.Positioner>
  </Menu.RootProvider>
</div>

```

### Grouping

Use `Menu.ItemGroup` and `Menu.ItemGroupLabel` to organize related menu items.

**Example: group**

#### React

```tsx
import { Menu } from '@ark-ui/react/menu'
import { ChevronDownIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import styles from 'styles/menu.module.css'

export const Group = () => (
  <Menu.Root>
    <Menu.Trigger className={styles.Trigger}>
      Edit
      <Menu.Indicator className={styles.Indicator}>
        <ChevronDownIcon />
      </Menu.Indicator>
    </Menu.Trigger>
    <Menu.Positioner>
      <Menu.Content className={styles.Content}>
        <Menu.ItemGroup className={styles.ItemGroup}>
          <Menu.ItemGroupLabel className={styles.ItemGroupLabel}>Clipboard</Menu.ItemGroupLabel>
          <Menu.Item className={styles.Item} value="cut">
            Cut
          </Menu.Item>
          <Menu.Item className={styles.Item} value="copy">
            Copy
          </Menu.Item>
          <Menu.Item className={styles.Item} value="paste">
            Paste
          </Menu.Item>
        </Menu.ItemGroup>
        <Menu.ItemGroup className={styles.ItemGroup}>
          <Menu.ItemGroupLabel className={styles.ItemGroupLabel}>Selection</Menu.ItemGroupLabel>
          <Menu.Item className={styles.Item} value="select-all">
            Select All
          </Menu.Item>
          <Menu.Item className={styles.Item} value="deselect">
            Deselect
          </Menu.Item>
        </Menu.ItemGroup>
      </Menu.Content>
    </Menu.Positioner>
  </Menu.Root>
)

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Menu } from '@ark-ui/solid/menu'
import { ChevronDownIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import styles from 'styles/menu.module.css'

export const Group = () => (
  <Menu.Root>
    <Menu.Trigger class={styles.Trigger}>
      Edit
      <Menu.Indicator class={styles.Indicator}>
        <ChevronDownIcon />

        <Menu.ItemGroup class={styles.ItemGroup}>
          <Menu.ItemGroupLabel class={styles.ItemGroupLabel}>Clipboard</Menu.ItemGroupLabel>
          <Menu.Item class={styles.Item} value="cut">
            Cut

### Links

To render menu items as links, use the `asChild` prop to replace the default element with an anchor tag.

**Example: links**

#### React

```tsx
import { Menu } from '@ark-ui/react/menu'
import { ChevronDownIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import styles from 'styles/menu.module.css'

export const Links = () => (
  <Menu.Root>
    <Menu.Trigger className={styles.Trigger}>
      Help
      <Menu.Indicator className={styles.Indicator}>
        <ChevronDownIcon />
      </Menu.Indicator>
    </Menu.Trigger>
    <Menu.Positioner>
      <Menu.Content className={styles.Content}>
        <Menu.Item className={styles.Item} value="docs" asChild>
          <a href="https://ark-ui.com">Documentation</a>
        </Menu.Item>
        <Menu.Item className={styles.Item} value="github" asChild>
          <a href="https://github.com/chakra-ui/ark">GitHub</a>
        </Menu.Item>
        <Menu.Separator className={styles.Separator} />
        <Menu.Item className={styles.Item} value="changelog" asChild>
          <a href="https://github.com/chakra-ui/ark/releases">Changelog</a>
        </Menu.Item>
      </Menu.Content>
    </Menu.Positioner>
  </Menu.Root>
)

```

### Checkbox

To add a checkbox to a menu item, use the `Menu.Checkbox` component.

**Example: checkbox-items**

#### React

```tsx
import { Menu } from '@ark-ui/react/menu'
import { CheckIcon, ChevronDownIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import { useState } from 'react'
import styles from 'styles/menu.module.css'

export const CheckboxItems = () => {
  const [showToolbar, setShowToolbar] = useState(true)
  const [showStatusBar, setShowStatusBar] = useState(false)

  return (
    <Menu.Root>
      <Menu.Trigger className={styles.Trigger}>
        View
        <Menu.Indicator className={styles.Indicator}>
          <ChevronDownIcon />
        </Menu.Indicator>
      </Menu.Trigger>
      <Menu.Positioner>
        <Menu.Content className={styles.Content}>
          <Menu.CheckboxItem
            className={styles.CheckboxItem}
            checked={showToolbar}
            onCheckedChange={setShowToolbar}
            value="toolbar"
          >
            <Menu.ItemIndicator className={styles.ItemIndicator}>
              <CheckIcon />
            </Menu.ItemIndicator>
            <Menu.ItemText className={styles.ItemText}>Show Toolbar</Menu.ItemText>
          </Menu.CheckboxItem>
          <Menu.CheckboxItem
            className={styles.CheckboxItem}
            checked={showStatusBar}
            onCheckedChange={setShowStatusBar}
            value="status-bar"
          >
            <Menu.ItemIndicator className={styles.ItemIndicator}>
              <CheckIcon />
            </Menu.ItemIndicator>
            <Menu.ItemText className={styles.ItemText}>Show Status Bar</Menu.ItemText>
          </Menu.CheckboxItem>

          </Menu.RadioItem>
          <Menu.RadioItem :class="styles.RadioItem" value="type">
            <Menu.ItemIndicator :class="styles.ItemIndicator">

            <Menu.ItemText :class="styles.ItemText">Type</Menu.ItemText>
          </Menu.RadioItem>
        </Menu.RadioItemGroup>
      </Menu.Content>
    </Menu.Positioner>
  </Menu.Root>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Menu } from '@ark-ui/svelte/menu'
  import { CheckIcon, ChevronDownIcon } from 'lucide-svelte'
  import styles from 'styles/menu.module.css'

  let sortBy = $state('date')
</script>

<Menu.Root>
  <Menu.Trigger class={styles.Trigger}>
    Sort
    <Menu.Indicator class={styles.Indicator}>
      <ChevronDownIcon />
    </Menu.Indicator>
  </Menu.Trigger>
  <Menu.Positioner>
    <Menu.Content class={styles.Content}>
      <Menu.RadioItemGroup class={styles.ItemGroup} bind:value={sortBy}>
        <Menu.ItemGroupLabel class={styles.ItemGroupLabel}>Sort By</Menu.ItemGroupLabel>

        </Menu.RadioItem>
      </Menu.RadioItemGroup>
    </Menu.Content>
  </Menu.Positioner>
</Menu.Root>

```

### Context Menu

To show the menu when a trigger element is right-clicked, use the `Menu.ContextTrigger` component.

Context menus are also opened during a long-press of roughly `700ms` when the pointer is pen or touch.

**Example: context**

#### React

```tsx
import { Menu } from '@ark-ui/react/menu'
import styles from 'styles/menu.module.css'

export const Context = () => (
  <Menu.Root>
    <Menu.ContextTrigger className={styles.ContextTrigger}>Right click here</Menu.ContextTrigger>
    <Menu.Positioner>
      <Menu.Content className={styles.Content}>
        <Menu.Item className={styles.Item} value="cut">
          Cut
        </Menu.Item>
        <Menu.Item className={styles.Item} value="copy">
          Copy
        </Menu.Item>
        <Menu.Item className={styles.Item} value="paste">
          Paste
        </Menu.Item>
        <Menu.Separator className={styles.Separator} />
        <Menu.Item className={styles.Item} value="delete">
          Delete
        </Menu.Item>
      </Menu.Content>
    </Menu.Positioner>
  </Menu.Root>
)

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Menu } from '@ark-ui/solid/menu'
import styles from 'styles/menu.module.css'

export const Context = () => (
  <Menu.Root>
    <Menu.ContextTrigger class={styles.ContextTrigger}>Right click here</Menu.ContextTrigger>
    <Menu.Positioner>
      <Menu.Content class={styles.Content}>
        <Menu.Item class={styles.Item} value="cut">
          Cut
        </Menu.Item>
        <Menu.Item class={styles.Item} value="copy">
          Copy
        </Menu.Item>
        <Menu.Item class={styles.Item} value="paste">
          Paste
        </Menu.Item>
        <Menu.Separator class={styles.Separator} />
        <Menu.Item class={styles.Item} value="delete">
          Delete
        </Menu.Item>
      </Menu.Content>
    </Menu.Positioner>
  </Menu.Root>
)

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Menu } from '@ark-ui/vue/menu'
import styles from 'styles/menu.module.css'
</script>

<template>
  <Menu.Root>
    <Menu.ContextTrigger :class="styles.ContextTrigger">Right click here</Menu.ContextTrigger>
    <Menu.Positioner>
      <Menu.Content :class="styles.Content">
        <Menu.Item :class="styles.Item" value="cut">Cut</Menu.Item>
        <Menu.Item :class="styles.Item" value="copy">Copy</Menu.Item>
        <Menu.Item :class="styles.Item" value="paste">Paste</Menu.Item>
        <Menu.Separator :class="styles.Separator" />
        <Menu.Item :class="styles.Item" value="delete">Delete</Menu.Item>
      </Menu.Content>
    </Menu.Positioner>
  </Menu.Root>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Menu } from '@ark-ui/svelte/menu'
  import styles from 'styles/menu.module.css'
</script>

<Menu.Root>
  <Menu.ContextTrigger class={styles.ContextTrigger}>Right click here</Menu.ContextTrigger>
  <Menu.Positioner>
    <Menu.Content class={styles.Content}>
      <Menu.Item class={styles.Item} value="cut">Cut</Menu.Item>
      <Menu.Item class={styles.Item} value="copy">Copy</Menu.Item>
      <Menu.Item class={styles.Item} value="paste">Paste</Menu.Item>
      <Menu.Separator class={styles.Separator} />
      <Menu.Item class={styles.Item} value="delete">Delete</Menu.Item>
    </Menu.Content>
  </Menu.Positioner>
</Menu.Root>

```

### Nested

To show a nested menu, render another `Menu` component and use the `Menu.TriggerItem` component to open the submenu.

**Example: nested**

#### React

```tsx
import { Menu } from '@ark-ui/react/menu'
import { Portal } from '@ark-ui/react/portal'
import { ChevronDownIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import styles from 'styles/menu.module.css'

export const Nested = () => (
  <Menu.Root>
    <Menu.Trigger className={styles.Trigger}>
      File
      <Menu.Indicator className={styles.Indicator}>
        <ChevronDownIcon />
      </Menu.Indicator>
    </Menu.Trigger>
    <Portal>
      <Menu.Positioner>
        <Menu.Content className={styles.Content}>
          <Menu.Item className={styles.Item} value="new">
            New File
          </Menu.Item>
          <Menu.Item className={styles.Item} value="open">
            Open...
          </Menu.Item>
          <Menu.Separator className={styles.Separator} />
          <Menu.Root>
            <Menu.TriggerItem className={styles.TriggerItem}>Share</Menu.TriggerItem>
            <Portal>
              <Menu.Positioner>
                <Menu.Content className={styles.Content}>
                  <Menu.Item className={styles.Item} value="email">

                  <Menu.Item className={styles.Item} value="message">
                    Message
                  </Menu.Item>
                  <Menu.Item className={styles.Item} value="airdrop">
                    AirDrop
                  </Menu.Item>
                </Menu.Content>
              </Menu.Positioner>
            </Portal>
          </Menu.Root>
          <Menu.Root>
            <Menu.TriggerItem className={styles.TriggerItem}>Export</Menu.TriggerItem>
            <Portal>
              <Menu.Positioner>
                <Menu.Content className={styles.Content}>
                  <Menu.Item className={styles.Item} value="pdf">
                    PDF
                  </Menu.Item>
                  <Menu.Item className={styles.Item} value="png">
                    PNG
                  </Menu.Item>
                  <Menu.Item className={styles.Item} value="svg">

            </Portal>
          </Menu.Root>
          <Menu.Separator className={styles.Separator} />
          <Menu.Item className={styles.Item} value="print">
            Print...
          </Menu.Item>
        </Menu.Content>
      </Menu.Positioner>
    </Portal>
  </Menu.Root>
)

```

### Menu in Dialog

When rendering a menu inside a dialog, use `lazyMount` and `unmountOnExit` to ensure proper cleanup when the dialog
closes.

**Example: menu-in-dialog**

#### React

```tsx
import { Dialog } from '@ark-ui/react/dialog'
import { Menu } from '@ark-ui/react/menu'
import { Portal } from '@ark-ui/react/portal'
import { ChevronDownIcon, XIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import dialog from 'styles/dialog.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/menu.module.css'

export const MenuInDialog = () => (
  <Dialog.Root>
    <Dialog.Trigger className={button.Root}>Open Dialog</Dialog.Trigger>
    <Portal>
      <Dialog.Backdrop className={dialog.Backdrop} />
      <Dialog.Positioner className={dialog.Positioner}>
        <Dialog.Content className={dialog.Content}>
          <Dialog.Title className={dialog.Title}>Settings</Dialog.Title>
          <Dialog.Description className={dialog.Description}>Configure your preferences below.</Dialog.Description>
          <Dialog.CloseTrigger className={dialog.CloseTrigger}>
            <XIcon />
          </Dialog.CloseTrigger>
          <div className={dialog.Body}>
            <Menu.Root lazyMount unmountOnExit>
              <Menu.Trigger className={styles.Trigger}>
                Select theme
                <Menu.Indicator className={styles.Indicator}>
                  <ChevronDownIcon />

              </Menu.Trigger>
              <Portal>
                <Menu.Positioner>
                  <Menu.Content className={styles.Content}>
                    <Menu.Arrow className={styles.Arrow}>
                      <Menu.ArrowTip className={styles.ArrowTip} />
                    </Menu.Arrow>

### Menu Item Dialog

Open a confirmation dialog from a menu item. This pattern is useful for destructive actions like delete that require
user confirmation.

## Guides

### Custom IDs

Ark UI autogenerates ids for menu items internally. Passing a custom `id` prop breaks the internal `getElementById`
functionality used by the component.

```tsx
// ❌ Don't do this
<Menu.Item id="custom-id" value="custom-value">
  Custom Item
</Menu.Item>

// ✅ Do this
<Menu.Item value="custom-value">
  Custom Item
</Menu.Item>
```

### Links

To render a menu item as a link, render the link as the menu item itself using the `asChild` prop, not as a child of the
menu item.

> This pattern ensures the link element receives the correct ARIA attributes and keyboard interactions from the menu
> item.

Here's an example of a reusable `MenuItemLink` component:

```tsx
interface MenuItemLinkProps extends Menu.ItemProps {
  href?: string
  target?: string
}

export const MenuItemLink = (props: MenuItemLinkProps) => {
  const { href, target, children, ...rest } = props
  return (
    <Menu.Item {...rest} asChild>
      <a href={href} target={target}>
        {children}
      </a>
    </Menu.Item>
  )
}
```

import styles from 'styles/number-input.module.css'
</script>

<template>
  <NumberInput.Root :class="styles.Root" :min="0" :max="10">
    <NumberInput.Label :class="styles.Label">Label</NumberInput.Label>
    <NumberInput.Control :class="styles.Control">
      <NumberInput.Input :class="styles.Input" />
      <div :class="styles.TriggerGroup">
        <NumberInput.IncrementTrigger :class="styles.IncrementTrigger">
          <ChevronUpIcon />
        </NumberInput.IncrementTrigger>
        <NumberInput.DecrementTrigger :class="styles.DecrementTrigger">
          <ChevronDownIcon />
        </NumberInput.DecrementTrigger>
      </div>
    </NumberInput.Control>
  </NumberInput.Root>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { NumberInput } from '@ark-ui/svelte/number-input'
  import { ChevronDownIcon, ChevronUpIcon } from 'lucide-svelte'
  import styles from 'styles/number-input.module.css'
</script>

<NumberInput.Root class={styles.Root} min={0} max={10}>
  <NumberInput.Label class={styles.Label}>Label</NumberInput.Label>
  <NumberInput.Control class={styles.Control}>
    <NumberInput.Input class={styles.Input} />
    <div class={styles.TriggerGroup}>
      <NumberInput.IncrementTrigger class={styles.IncrementTrigger}>
        <ChevronUpIcon />
      </NumberInput.IncrementTrigger>
      <NumberInput.DecrementTrigger class={styles.DecrementTrigger}>
        <ChevronDownIcon />
      </NumberInput.DecrementTrigger>
    </div>
  </NumberInput.Control>
</NumberInput.Root>

```

> To allow values outside the min/max range, set `clampValueOnBlur` to `false`.

### Precision

In some cases, you might need the value to be rounded to specific decimal points. Set the `formatOptions` and provide
`Intl.NumberFormatOptions` such as `maximumFractionDigits` or `minimumFractionDigits`.

**Example: fraction-digits**

#### React

```tsx
import { NumberInput } from '@ark-ui/react/number-input'
import { ChevronDownIcon, ChevronUpIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import styles from 'styles/number-input.module.css'

export const FractionDigits = () => (
  <NumberInput.Root
    className={styles.Root}
    formatOptions={{ minimumFractionDigits: 2, maximumFractionDigits: 3 }}
    defaultValue="1.00"
  >
    <NumberInput.Label className={styles.Label}>Label</NumberInput.Label>
    <NumberInput.Control className={styles.Control}>
      <NumberInput.Input className={styles.Input} />
      <div className={styles.TriggerGroup}>
        <NumberInput.IncrementTrigger className={styles.IncrementTrigger}>
          <ChevronUpIcon />
        </NumberInput.IncrementTrigger>
        <NumberInput.DecrementTrigger className={styles.DecrementTrigger}>
          <ChevronDownIcon />
        </NumberInput.DecrementTrigger>
      </div>
    </NumberInput.Control>
  </NumberInput.Root>
)

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { NumberInput } from '@ark-ui/solid/number-input'
import { ChevronDownIcon, ChevronUpIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import styles from 'styles/number-input.module.css'

export const FractionDigits = () => (
  <NumberInput.Root
    class={styles.Root}
    formatOptions={{ minimumFractionDigits: 2, maximumFractionDigits: 3 }}
    defaultValue="1.00"
  >
    <NumberInput.Label class={styles.Label}>Label</NumberInput.Label>
    <NumberInput.Control class={styles.Control}>
      <NumberInput.Input class={styles.Input} />
      <div class={styles.TriggerGroup}>
        <NumberInput.IncrementTrigger class={styles.IncrementTrigger}>
          <ChevronUpIcon />
        </NumberInput.IncrementTrigger>
        <NumberInput.DecrementTrigger class={styles.DecrementTrigger}>
          <ChevronDownIcon />
        </NumberInput.DecrementTrigger>
      </div>
    </NumberInput.Control>
  </NumberInput.Root>
)

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { NumberInput } from '@ark-ui/vue/number-input'
import { ChevronDownIcon, ChevronUpIcon } from 'lucide-vue-next'
import styles from 'styles/number-input.module.css'
</script>

<template>
  <NumberInput.Root
    :class="styles.Root"
    :formatOptions="{ minimumFractionDigits: 2, maximumFractionDigits: 3 }"
    defaultValue="1.00"
  >
    <NumberInput.Label :class="styles.Label">Label</NumberInput.Label>
    <NumberInput.Control :class="styles.Control">
      <NumberInput.Input :class="styles.Input" />
      <div :class="styles.TriggerGroup">
        <NumberInput.IncrementTrigger :class="styles.IncrementTrigger">
          <ChevronUpIcon />
        </NumberInput.IncrementTrigger>
        <NumberInput.DecrementTrigger :class="styles.DecrementTrigger">
          <ChevronDownIcon />
        </NumberInput.DecrementTrigger>
      </div>
    </NumberInput.Control>
  </NumberInput.Root>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { NumberInput } from '@ark-ui/svelte/number-input'
  import { ChevronDownIcon, ChevronUpIcon } from 'lucide-svelte'
  import styles from 'styles/number-input.module.css'
</script>

<NumberInput.Root
  class={styles.Root}
  formatOptions={{ minimumFractionDigits: 2, maximumFractionDigits: 3 }}
  defaultValue="1.00"
>
  <NumberInput.Label class={styles.Label}>Label</NumberInput.Label>
  <NumberInput.Control class={styles.Control}>
    <NumberInput.Input class={styles.Input} />
    <div class={styles.TriggerGroup}>
      <NumberInput.IncrementTrigger class={styles.IncrementTrigger}>
        <ChevronUpIcon />
      </NumberInput.IncrementTrigger>
      <NumberInput.DecrementTrigger class={styles.DecrementTrigger}>
        <ChevronDownIcon />
      </NumberInput.DecrementTrigger>
    </div>
  </NumberInput.Control>
</NumberInput.Root>

```

### Scrubbing

The NumberInput supports the scrubber interaction pattern. To use this pattern, render the `NumberInput.Scrubber`
component. It uses the Pointer lock API and tracks the pointer movement. It also renders a virtual cursor which mimics
the real cursor's pointer.

**Example: scrubber**

#### React

```tsx
import { NumberInput } from '@ark-ui/react/number-input'
import { ChevronDownIcon, ChevronUpIcon, ArrowLeftRightIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import styles from 'styles/number-input.module.css'

export const Scrubber = () => (
  <NumberInput.Root className={styles.Root} defaultValue="32">
    <NumberInput.Label className={styles.Label}>Label</NumberInput.Label>
    <NumberInput.Control className={styles.Control}>
      <NumberInput.Scrubber className={styles.Scrubber}>
        <ArrowLeftRightIcon />
      </NumberInput.Scrubber>
      <NumberInput.Input className={styles.Input} data-has-scrubber />
      <div className={styles.TriggerGroup}>
        <NumberInput.IncrementTrigger className={styles.IncrementTrigger}>
          <ChevronUpIcon />
        </NumberInput.IncrementTrigger>
        <NumberInput.DecrementTrigger className={styles.DecrementTrigger}>
          <ChevronDownIcon />
        </NumberInput.DecrementTrigger>
      </div>
    </NumberInput.Control>
  </NumberInput.Root>
)

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { NumberInput } from '@ark-ui/solid/number-input'
import { ArrowLeftRightIcon, ChevronDownIcon, ChevronUpIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import styles from 'styles/number-input.module.css'

export const Scrubber = () => (
  <NumberInput.Root class={styles.Root} defaultValue="32">
    <NumberInput.Label class={styles.Label}>Label</NumberInput.Label>
    <NumberInput.Control class={styles.Control}>
      <NumberInput.Scrubber class={styles.Scrubber}>
        <ArrowLeftRightIcon />
      </NumberInput.Scrubber>
      <NumberInput.Input class={styles.Input} data-has-scrubber />
      <div class={styles.TriggerGroup}>
        <NumberInput.IncrementTrigger class={styles.IncrementTrigger}>
          <ChevronUpIcon />
        </NumberInput.IncrementTrigger>
        <NumberInput.DecrementTrigger class={styles.DecrementTrigger}>
          <ChevronDownIcon />
        </NumberInput.DecrementTrigger>
      </div>
    </NumberInput.Control>
  </NumberInput.Root>
)

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { NumberInput } from '@ark-ui/vue/number-input'
import { ArrowLeftRightIcon, ChevronDownIcon, ChevronUpIcon } from 'lucide-vue-next'
import styles from 'styles/number-input.module.css'
</script>

<template>
  <NumberInput.Root :class="styles.Root" defaultValue="32">
    <NumberInput.Label :class="styles.Label">Label</NumberInput.Label>
    <NumberInput.Control :class="styles.Control">
      <NumberInput.Scrubber :class="styles.Scrubber">
        <ArrowLeftRightIcon />
      </NumberInput.Scrubber>
      <NumberInput.Input :class="styles.Input" data-has-scrubber />
      <div :class="styles.TriggerGroup">
        <NumberInput.IncrementTrigger :class="styles.IncrementTrigger">
          <ChevronUpIcon />
        </NumberInput.IncrementTrigger>
        <NumberInput.DecrementTrigger :class="styles.DecrementTrigger">
          <ChevronDownIcon />
        </NumberInput.DecrementTrigger>
      </div>
    </NumberInput.Control>
  </NumberInput.Root>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { NumberInput } from '@ark-ui/svelte/number-input'
  import { ArrowLeftRightIcon, ChevronDownIcon, ChevronUpIcon } from 'lucide-svelte'
  import styles from 'styles/number-input.module.css'
</script>

<NumberInput.Root class={styles.Root} defaultValue="32">
  <NumberInput.Label class={styles.Label}>Label</NumberInput.Label>
  <NumberInput.Control class={styles.Control}>
    <NumberInput.Scrubber class={styles.Scrubber}>
      <ArrowLeftRightIcon />
    </NumberInput.Scrubber>
    <NumberInput.Input class={styles.Input} data-has-scrubber />
    <div class={styles.TriggerGroup}>
      <NumberInput.IncrementTrigger class={styles.IncrementTrigger}>
        <ChevronUpIcon />
      </NumberInput.IncrementTrigger>
      <NumberInput.DecrementTrigger class={styles.DecrementTrigger}>
        <ChevronDownIcon />
      </NumberInput.DecrementTrigger>
    </div>
  </NumberInput.Control>
</NumberInput.Root>

```

### Mouse Wheel

The NumberInput exposes a way to increment/decrement the value using the mouse wheel event. To activate this, set the
`allowMouseWheel` prop to `true`.

**Example: mouse-wheel**

#### React

```tsx
import { NumberInput } from '@ark-ui/react/number-input'
import { ChevronDownIcon, ChevronUpIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import styles from 'styles/number-input.module.css'

export const MouseWheel = () => (
  <NumberInput.Root className={styles.Root} allowMouseWheel>
    <NumberInput.Label className={styles.Label}>Label</NumberInput.Label>
    <NumberInput.Control className={styles.Control}>
      <NumberInput.Input className={styles.Input} />
      <div className={styles.TriggerGroup}>
        <NumberInput.IncrementTrigger className={styles.IncrementTrigger}>
          <ChevronUpIcon />
        </NumberInput.IncrementTrigger>
        <NumberInput.DecrementTrigger className={styles.DecrementTrigger}>
          <ChevronDownIcon />
        </NumberInput.DecrementTrigger>
      </div>
    </NumberInput.Control>
  </NumberInput.Root>
)

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { NumberInput } from '@ark-ui/solid/number-input'
import { ChevronDownIcon, ChevronUpIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import styles from 'styles/number-input.module.css'

export const MouseWheel = () => (
  <NumberInput.Root class={styles.Root} allowMouseWheel>
    <NumberInput.Label class={styles.Label}>Label</NumberInput.Label>
    <NumberInput.Control class={styles.Control}>
      <NumberInput.Input class={styles.Input} />
      <div class={styles.TriggerGroup}>
        <NumberInput.IncrementTrigger class={styles.IncrementTrigger}>
          <ChevronUpIcon />
        </NumberInput.IncrementTrigger>
        <NumberInput.DecrementTrigger class={styles.DecrementTrigger}>
          <ChevronDownIcon />
        </NumberInput.DecrementTrigger>
      </div>
    </NumberInput.Control>
  </NumberInput.Root>
)

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { NumberInput } from '@ark-ui/vue/number-input'
import { ChevronDownIcon, ChevronUpIcon } from 'lucide-vue-next'
import styles from 'styles/number-input.module.css'
</script>

<template>
  <NumberInput.Root :class="styles.Root" allowMouseWheel>
    <NumberInput.Label :class="styles.Label">Label</NumberInput.Label>
    <NumberInput.Control :class="styles.Control">
      <NumberInput.Input :class="styles.Input" />
      <div :class="styles.TriggerGroup">
        <NumberInput.IncrementTrigger :class="styles.IncrementTrigger">
          <ChevronUpIcon />
        </NumberInput.IncrementTrigger>
        <NumberInput.DecrementTrigger :class="styles.DecrementTrigger">
          <ChevronDownIcon />
        </NumberInput.DecrementTrigger>
      </div>
    </NumberInput.Control>
  </NumberInput.Root>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { NumberInput } from '@ark-ui/svelte/number-input'
  import { ChevronDownIcon, ChevronUpIcon } from 'lucide-svelte'
  import styles from 'styles/number-input.module.css'
</script>

<NumberInput.Root class={styles.Root} allowMouseWheel>
  <NumberInput.Label class={styles.Label}>Label</NumberInput.Label>
  <NumberInput.Control class={styles.Control}>
    <NumberInput.Input class={styles.Input} />
    <div class={styles.TriggerGroup}>
      <NumberInput.IncrementTrigger class={styles.IncrementTrigger}>
        <ChevronUpIcon />
      </NumberInput.IncrementTrigger>
      <NumberInput.DecrementTrigger class={styles.DecrementTrigger}>
        <ChevronDownIcon />
      </NumberInput.DecrementTrigger>
    </div>
  </NumberInput.Control>
</NumberInput.Root>

```

### Formatting

To apply custom formatting to the input's value, set the `formatOptions` and provide `Intl.NumberFormatOptions` such as
`style` and `currency`.

**Example: formatting**

#### React

```tsx
import { NumberInput } from '@ark-ui/react/number-input'
import { ChevronDownIcon, ChevronUpIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import styles from 'styles/number-input.module.css'

export const Formatting = () => (
  <NumberInput.Root
    className={styles.Root}
    formatOptions={{
      style: 'currency',
      currency: 'USD',
    }}
  >
    <NumberInput.Label className={styles.Label}>Label</NumberInput.Label>
    <NumberInput.Control className={styles.Control}>
      <NumberInput.Input className={styles.Input} />
      <div className={styles.TriggerGroup}>
        <NumberInput.IncrementTrigger className={styles.IncrementTrigger}>
          <ChevronUpIcon />
        </NumberInput.IncrementTrigger>
        <NumberInput.DecrementTrigger className={styles.DecrementTrigger}>
          <ChevronDownIcon />
        </NumberInput.DecrementTrigger>
      </div>
    </NumberInput.Control>
  </NumberInput.Root>
)

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { NumberInput } from '@ark-ui/solid/number-input'
import { ChevronDownIcon, ChevronUpIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import styles from 'styles/number-input.module.css'

export const Formatting = () => (
  <NumberInput.Root
    class={styles.Root}
    formatOptions={{
      style: 'currency',
      currency: 'USD',
    }}
  >
    <NumberInput.Label class={styles.Label}>Label</NumberInput.Label>
    <NumberInput.Control class={styles.Control}>
      <NumberInput.Input class={styles.Input} />
      <div class={styles.TriggerGroup}>
        <NumberInput.IncrementTrigger class={styles.IncrementTrigger}>
          <ChevronUpIcon />
        </NumberInput.IncrementTrigger>
        <NumberInput.DecrementTrigger class={styles.DecrementTrigger}>
          <ChevronDownIcon />
        </NumberInput.DecrementTrigger>
      </div>
    </NumberInput.Control>
  </NumberInput.Root>
)

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { NumberInput } from '@ark-ui/vue/number-input'
import { ChevronDownIcon, ChevronUpIcon } from 'lucide-vue-next'
import styles from 'styles/number-input.module.css'
</script>

<template>
  <NumberInput.Root :class="styles.Root" :formatOptions="{ style: 'currency', currency: 'USD' }">
    <NumberInput.Label :class="styles.Label">Label</NumberInput.Label>
    <NumberInput.Control :class="styles.Control">
      <NumberInput.Input :class="styles.Input" />
      <div :class="styles.TriggerGroup">
        <NumberInput.IncrementTrigger :class="styles.IncrementTrigger">
          <ChevronUpIcon />
        </NumberInput.IncrementTrigger>
        <NumberInput.DecrementTrigger :class="styles.DecrementTrigger">
          <ChevronDownIcon />
        </NumberInput.DecrementTrigger>
      </div>
    </NumberInput.Control>
  </NumberInput.Root>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { NumberInput } from '@ark-ui/svelte/number-input'
  import { ChevronDownIcon, ChevronUpIcon } from 'lucide-svelte'
  import styles from 'styles/number-input.module.css'
</script>

<NumberInput.Root
  class={styles.Root}
  formatOptions={{
    style: 'currency',
    currency: 'USD',
  }}
>
  <NumberInput.Label class={styles.Label}>Label</NumberInput.Label>
  <NumberInput.Control class={styles.Control}>
    <NumberInput.Input class={styles.Input} />
    <div class={styles.TriggerGroup}>
      <NumberInput.IncrementTrigger class={styles.IncrementTrigger}>
        <ChevronUpIcon />
      </NumberInput.IncrementTrigger>
      <NumberInput.DecrementTrigger class={styles.DecrementTrigger}>
        <ChevronDownIcon />
      </NumberInput.DecrementTrigger>
    </div>
  </NumberInput.Control>
</NumberInput.Root>

```

### Field

The `Field` component helps manage form-related state and accessibility attributes of a number input. It includes
handling ARIA labels, helper text, and error text to ensure proper accessibility.

**Example: with-field**

#### React

```tsx
import { Field } from '@ark-ui/react/field'
import { NumberInput } from '@ark-ui/react/number-input'
import { ChevronDownIcon, ChevronUpIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import field from 'styles/field.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/number-input.module.css'

export const WithField = () => (
  <Field.Root className={field.Root}>
    <NumberInput.Root className={styles.Root}>
      <NumberInput.Label className={styles.Label}>Label</NumberInput.Label>
      <NumberInput.Control className={styles.Control}>
        <NumberInput.Input className={styles.Input} />
        <div className={styles.TriggerGroup}>
          <NumberInput.IncrementTrigger className={styles.IncrementTrigger}>
            <ChevronUpIcon />
          </NumberInput.IncrementTrigger>
          <NumberInput.DecrementTrigger className={styles.DecrementTrigger}>
            <ChevronDownIcon />
          </NumberInput.DecrementTrigger>
        </div>
      </NumberInput.Control>
    </NumberInput.Root>
    <Field.HelperText className={field.HelperText}>Additional Info</Field.HelperText>
    <Field.ErrorText className={field.ErrorText}>Error Info</Field.ErrorText>
  </Field.Root>
)

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Field } from '@ark-ui/solid/field'
import { NumberInput } from '@ark-ui/solid/number-input'
import { ChevronDownIcon, ChevronUpIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import field from 'styles/field.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/number-input.module.css'

export const WithField = () => (
  <Field.Root class={field.Root}>
    <NumberInput.Root class={styles.Root}>
      <NumberInput.Label class={styles.Label}>Label</NumberInput.Label>
      <NumberInput.Control class={styles.Control}>
        <NumberInput.Input class={styles.Input} />
        <div class={styles.TriggerGroup}>
          <NumberInput.IncrementTrigger class={styles.IncrementTrigger}>
            <ChevronUpIcon />
          </NumberInput.IncrementTrigger>
          <NumberInput.DecrementTrigger class={styles.DecrementTrigger}>
            <ChevronDownIcon />
          </NumberInput.DecrementTrigger>
        </div>
      </NumberInput.Control>
    </NumberInput.Root>
    <Field.HelperText class={field.HelperText}>Additional Info</Field.HelperText>
    <Field.ErrorText class={field.ErrorText}>Error Info</Field.ErrorText>
  </Field.Root>
)

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Field } from '@ark-ui/vue/field'
import { NumberInput } from '@ark-ui/vue/number-input'
import { ChevronDownIcon, ChevronUpIcon } from 'lucide-vue-next'
import field from 'styles/field.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/number-input.module.css'
</script>

<template>
  <Field.Root :class="field.Root">
    <NumberInput.Root :class="styles.Root">
      <NumberInput.Label :class="styles.Label">Label</NumberInput.Label>
      <NumberInput.Control :class="styles.Control">
        <NumberInput.Input :class="styles.Input" />
        <div :class="styles.TriggerGroup">
          <NumberInput.IncrementTrigger :class="styles.IncrementTrigger">
            <ChevronUpIcon />
          </NumberInput.IncrementTrigger>
          <NumberInput.DecrementTrigger :class="styles.DecrementTrigger">
            <ChevronDownIcon />
          </NumberInput.DecrementTrigger>
        </div>
      </NumberInput.Control>
    </NumberInput.Root>
    <Field.HelperText :class="field.HelperText">Additional Info</Field.HelperText>
    <Field.ErrorText :class="field.ErrorText">Error Info</Field.ErrorText>
  </Field.Root>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Field } from '@ark-ui/svelte/field'
  import { NumberInput } from '@ark-ui/svelte/number-input'
  import { ChevronDownIcon, ChevronUpIcon } from 'lucide-svelte'
  import field from 'styles/field.module.css'
  import styles from 'styles/number-input.module.css'
</script>

<Field.Root class={field.Root}>
  <NumberInput.Root class={styles.Root}>
    <NumberInput.Label class={styles.Label}>Label</NumberInput.Label>
    <NumberInput.Control class={styles.Control}>
      <NumberInput.Input class={styles.Input} />
      <div class={styles.TriggerGroup}>
        <NumberInput.IncrementTrigger class={styles.IncrementTrigger}>
          <ChevronUpIcon />
        </NumberInput.IncrementTrigger>
        <NumberInput.DecrementTrigger class={styles.DecrementTrigger}>
          <ChevronDownIcon />
        </NumberInput.DecrementTrigger>
      </div>
    </NumberInput.Control>
  </NumberInput.Root>
  <Field.HelperText class={field.HelperText}>Additional Info</Field.HelperText>
  <Field.ErrorText class={field.ErrorText}>Error Info</Field.ErrorText>
</Field.Root>

```

### Root Provider

An alternative way to control the number input is to use the `RootProvider` component and the `useNumberInput` hook.
This way you can access the state and methods from outside the component.

**Example: root-provider**

## Guides

### Scrubber

The `NumberInput.Scrubber` component provides an interactive scrub area that allows users to drag to change the input
value. It renders as a `<div>` element and displays a custom cursor element during scrubbing interactions.

This component utilizes the [Pointer Lock API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Pointer_Lock_API) for
smooth dragging interactions.

> **Note:** Browsers may show a notification when the Pointer Lock API is activated. The scrubber is automatically
> disabled in Safari to prevent layout shifts.

### Controlled

When controlling the NumberInput component, it's recommended to use string values instead of converting to numbers. This
is especially important when using `formatOptions` for currency or locale-specific formatting.

```tsx
const [value, setValue] = useState('0')

<NumberInput.Root value={value} onValueChange={(details) => setValue(details.value)}>
  {/* ... */}
</NumberInput.Root>
```

Converting values to numbers can cause issues with locale-specific formatting, particularly for currencies that use
different decimal and thousands separators (e.g., `1.523,30` vs `1,523.30`). By keeping values as strings, you preserve
the correct formatting and avoid parsing issues.

If you need to submit a numeric value in your form, use a hidden input that reads `valueAsNumber` from
`NumberInput.Context`:

```tsx
<NumberInput.Root value={value} onValueChange={(details) => setValue(details.value)}>
  <NumberInput.Input />
  <NumberInput.Context>
    {(context) => <input type="hidden" name="amount" value={context.valueAsNumber} />}
  </NumberInput.Context>
</NumberInput.Root>
```

# Pagination



## Anatomy



```tsx
<Pagination.Root>
  <Pagination.PrevTrigger />
  <Pagination.Item />
  <Pagination.Ellipsis />
  <Pagination.NextTrigger />
</Pagination.Root>
```

## Examples

**Example: basic**

#### React

```tsx
import { ChevronLeftIcon, ChevronRightIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import { Pagination } from '@ark-ui/react/pagination'
import styles from 'styles/pagination.module.css'

export const Basic = () => (
  <Pagination.Root count={5000} pageSize={10} siblingCount={2} className={styles.Root}>
    <div className={styles.Controls}>
      <Pagination.PrevTrigger className={styles.Trigger}>
        <ChevronLeftIcon />
      </Pagination.PrevTrigger>
      <Pagination.Context>
        {(pagination) =>
          pagination.pages.map((page, index) =>
            page.type === 'page' ? (
              <Pagination.Item key={index} {...page} className={styles.Item}>
                {page.value}
              </Pagination.Item>
            ) : (
              <Pagination.Ellipsis key={index} index={index} className={styles.Ellipsis}>
                &#8230;
              </Pagination.Ellipsis>
            ),
          )
        }
      </Pagination.Context>
      <Pagination.NextTrigger className={styles.Trigger}>
        <ChevronRightIcon />
      </Pagination.NextTrigger>
    </div>
  </Pagination.Root>
)

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { ChevronLeftIcon, ChevronRightIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { Pagination } from '@ark-ui/solid/pagination'
import { For } from 'solid-js'
import styles from 'styles/pagination.module.css'

export const Basic = () => (
  <Pagination.Root count={5000} pageSize={10} siblingCount={2} class={styles.Root}>
    <div class={styles.Controls}>
      <Pagination.PrevTrigger class={styles.Trigger}>
        <ChevronLeftIcon />

                  &#8230;
                </Pagination.Ellipsis>
              )
            }
          </For>
        )}
      </Pagination.Context>
      <Pagination.NextTrigger class={styles.Trigger}>
        <ChevronRightIcon />
      </Pagination.NextTrigger>
    </div>
  </Pagination.Root>
)

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { ChevronLeft, ChevronRight } from 'lucide-vue-next'
import { Pagination } from '@ark-ui/vue/pagination'
import styles from 'styles/pagination.module.css'
</script>

<template>
  <Pagination.Root :count="5000" :page-size="10" :sibling-count="2" :class="styles.Root">
    <div :class="styles.Controls">
      <Pagination.PrevTrigger :class="styles.Trigger">
        <ChevronLeft />
      </Pagination.PrevTrigger>
      <Pagination.Context v-slot="pagination">
        <template v-for="(page, index) in pagination.pages" :key="index">
          <Pagination.Item v-if="page.type === 'page'" v-bind="page" :class="styles.Item">
            {{ page.value }}
          </Pagination.Item>
          <Pagination.Ellipsis v-else :index="index" :class="styles.Ellipsis">&#8230;</Pagination.Ellipsis>
        </template>
      </Pagination.Context>
      <Pagination.NextTrigger :class="styles.Trigger">
        <ChevronRight />
      </Pagination.NextTrigger>
    </div>
  </Pagination.Root>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { ChevronLeft, ChevronRight } from 'lucide-svelte'
  import { Pagination } from '@ark-ui/svelte/pagination'
  import styles from 'styles/pagination.module.css'
</script>

<Pagination.Root count={5000} pageSize={10} siblingCount={2} class={styles.Root}>
  <div class={styles.Controls}>
    <Pagination.PrevTrigger class={styles.Trigger}>
      <ChevronLeft />
    </Pagination.PrevTrigger>
    <Pagination.Context>
      {#snippet render(pagination)}
        {#each pagination().pages as page, index (index)}
          {#if page.type === 'page'}
            <Pagination.Item {...page} class={styles.Item}>
              {page.value}
            </Pagination.Item>
          {:else}
            <Pagination.Ellipsis {index} class={styles.Ellipsis}>&#8230;</Pagination.Ellipsis>
          {/if}
        {/each}
      {/snippet}
    </Pagination.Context>
    <Pagination.NextTrigger class={styles.Trigger}>
      <ChevronRight />
    </Pagination.NextTrigger>
  </div>
</Pagination.Root>

```

### Controlled

To create a controlled Pagination component, manage the state of the current page using the `page` prop and update it
when the `onPageChange` event handler is called:

**Example: controlled**

#### React

```tsx
import { ChevronLeftIcon, ChevronRightIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import { useState } from 'react'
import { Pagination } from '@ark-ui/react/pagination'
import styles from 'styles/pagination.module.css'

export const Controlled = () => {
  const [currentPage, setCurrentPage] = useState(1)

  return (
    <Pagination.Root
      count={5000}
      pageSize={10}
      siblingCount={2}
      page={currentPage}
      onPageChange={(details) => setCurrentPage(details.page)}
      className={styles.Root}
    >
      <div className={styles.Controls}>
        <Pagination.PrevTrigger className={styles.Trigger}>
          <ChevronLeftIcon />
        </Pagination.PrevTrigger>
        <Pagination.Context>
          {(pagination) =>
            pagination.pages.map((page, index) =>
              page.type === 'page' ? (
                <Pagination.Item key={index} {...page} className={styles.Item}>
                  {page.value}
                </Pagination.Item>
              ) : (
                <Pagination.Ellipsis key={index} index={index} className={styles.Ellipsis}>
                  &#8230;
                </Pagination.Ellipsis>
              ),
            )
          }
        </Pagination.Context>
        <Pagination.NextTrigger className={styles.Trigger}>
          <ChevronRightIcon />
        </Pagination.NextTrigger>
      </div>
    </Pagination.Root>
  )
}

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { ChevronLeftIcon, ChevronRightIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { Pagination } from '@ark-ui/solid/pagination'
import { For, createSignal } from 'solid-js'
import styles from 'styles/pagination.module.css'

export const Controlled = () => {
  const [currentPage, setCurrentPage] = createSignal(1)

  return (
    <Pagination.Root
      count={5000}
      pageSize={10}
      siblingCount={2}
      page={currentPage()}
      onPageChange={(details) => setCurrentPage(details.page)}
      class={styles.Root}
    >
      <div class={styles.Controls}>
        <Pagination.PrevTrigger class={styles.Trigger}>
          <ChevronLeftIcon />
        </Pagination.PrevTrigger>
        <Pagination.Context>
          {(pagination) => (
            <For each={pagination().pages}>
              {(page, index) =>
                page.type === 'page' ? (
                  <Pagination.Item {...page} class={styles.Item}>
                    {page.value}
                  </Pagination.Item>
                ) : (
                  <Pagination.Ellipsis index={index()} class={styles.Ellipsis}>
                    &#8230;
                  </Pagination.Ellipsis>
                )
              }
            </For>
          )}
        </Pagination.Context>
        <Pagination.NextTrigger class={styles.Trigger}>
          <ChevronRightIcon />
        </Pagination.NextTrigger>
      </div>
    </Pagination.Root>
  )
}

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { ChevronLeft, ChevronRight } from 'lucide-vue-next'
import { Pagination } from '@ark-ui/vue/pagination'
import { ref } from 'vue'
import styles from 'styles/pagination.module.css'

const currentPage = ref(1)
</script>

<template>
  <Pagination.Root :count="5000" :page-size="10" :sibling-count="2" v-model:page="currentPage" :class="styles.Root">
    <div :class="styles.Controls">
      <Pagination.PrevTrigger :class="styles.Trigger">
        <ChevronLeft />
      </Pagination.PrevTrigger>
      <Pagination.Context v-slot="pagination">
        <template v-for="(page, index) in pagination.pages" :key="index">
          <Pagination.Item v-if="page.type === 'page'" v-bind="page" :class="styles.Item">
            {{ page.value }}
          </Pagination.Item>
          <Pagination.Ellipsis v-else :index="index" :class="styles.Ellipsis">&#8230;</Pagination.Ellipsis>
        </template>
      </Pagination.Context>
      <Pagination.NextTrigger :class="styles.Trigger">
        <ChevronRight />
      </Pagination.NextTrigger>
    </div>
  </Pagination.Root>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { ChevronLeft, ChevronRight } from 'lucide-svelte'
  import { Pagination } from '@ark-ui/svelte/pagination'
  import styles from 'styles/pagination.module.css'

  let page = $state(1)
</script>

<Pagination.Root count={5000} pageSize={10} siblingCount={2} bind:page class={styles.Root}>
  <div class={styles.Controls}>
    <Pagination.PrevTrigger class={styles.Trigger}>
      <ChevronLeft />
    </Pagination.PrevTrigger>
    <Pagination.Context>
      {#snippet render(pagination)}
        {#each pagination().pages as page, index (index)}
          {#if page.type === 'page'}
            <Pagination.Item {...page} class={styles.Item}>
              {page.value}
            </Pagination.Item>
          {:else}
            <Pagination.Ellipsis {index} class={styles.Ellipsis}>&#8230;</Pagination.Ellipsis>
          {/if}
        {/each}
      {/snippet}
    </Pagination.Context>
    <Pagination.NextTrigger class={styles.Trigger}>
      <ChevronRight />
    </Pagination.NextTrigger>
  </div>
</Pagination.Root>

```

### Root Provider

An alternative way to control the pagination is to use the `RootProvider` component and the `usePagination` hook. This
way you can access the state and methods from outside the component.

**Example: root-provider**

#### React

```tsx
import { ChevronLeftIcon, ChevronRightIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import { Pagination, usePagination } from '@ark-ui/react/pagination'
import styles from 'styles/pagination.module.css'

export const RootProvider = () => {
  const pagination = usePagination({ count: 5000, pageSize: 10, siblingCount: 2 })

  return (
    <div className="stack">
      <button className={styles.Trigger} onClick={() => pagination.goToNextPage()}>
        Next Page
      </button>

      <Pagination.RootProvider value={pagination} className={styles.Root}>
        <div className={styles.Controls}>
          <Pagination.PrevTrigger className={styles.Trigger}>
            <ChevronLeftIcon />
          </Pagination.PrevTrigger>
          <Pagination.Context>
            {(pagination) =>
              pagination.pages.map((page, index) =>
                page.type === 'page' ? (
                  <Pagination.Item key={index} {...page} className={styles.Item}>
                    {page.value}
                  </Pagination.Item>
                ) : (
                  <Pagination.Ellipsis key={index} index={index} className={styles.Ellipsis}>
                    &#8230;
                  </Pagination.Ellipsis>
                ),
              )
            }
          </Pagination.Context>
          <Pagination.NextTrigger className={styles.Trigger}>
            <ChevronRightIcon />
          </Pagination.NextTrigger>
        </div>
      </Pagination.RootProvider>
    </div>
  )
}

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { ChevronLeftIcon, ChevronRightIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { Pagination, usePagination } from '@ark-ui/solid/pagination'
import { For } from 'solid-js'
import styles from 'styles/pagination.module.css'

export const RootProvider = () => {
  const pagination = usePagination({ count: 5000, pageSize: 10, siblingCount: 2 })

  return (
    <div class="stack">
      <button class={styles.Trigger} onClick={() => pagination().goToNextPage()}>
        Next Page

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">

  import { Pagination, usePagination } from '@ark-ui/svelte/pagination'
  import styles from 'styles/pagination.module.css'

### Customization

You can customize the Pagination component by setting various props such as `dir`, `pageSize`, `siblingCount`, and
`translations`. Here's an example of a customized Pagination:

**Example: customized**

#### React

```tsx
import { ChevronLeftIcon, ChevronRightIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import { Pagination } from '@ark-ui/react/pagination'
import styles from 'styles/pagination.module.css'

export const Customized = () => (
  <Pagination.Root
    count={5000}
    pageSize={20}
    siblingCount={3}
    translations={{
      nextTriggerLabel: 'Next',
      prevTriggerLabel: 'Prev',
      itemLabel: (details) => `Page ${details.page}`,
    }}
    className={styles.Root}
  >
    <div className={styles.Controls}>
      <Pagination.PrevTrigger className={styles.Trigger}>
        <ChevronLeftIcon />
      </Pagination.PrevTrigger>
      <Pagination.Context>
        {(pagination) =>
          pagination.pages.map((page, index) =>
            page.type === 'page' ? (
              <Pagination.Item key={index} {...page} className={styles.Item}>
                {page.value}
              </Pagination.Item>
            ) : (
              <Pagination.Ellipsis key={index} index={index} className={styles.Ellipsis}>
                &#8230;
              </Pagination.Ellipsis>
            ),
          )
        }
      </Pagination.Context>
      <Pagination.NextTrigger className={styles.Trigger}>
        <ChevronRightIcon />
      </Pagination.NextTrigger>
    </div>
  </Pagination.Root>
)

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { ChevronLeftIcon, ChevronRightIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { Pagination } from '@ark-ui/solid/pagination'
import { For } from 'solid-js'
import styles from 'styles/pagination.module.css'

export const Customized = () => {
  return (
    <Pagination.Root
      count={5000}
      pageSize={20}
      siblingCount={3}
      translations={{
        nextTriggerLabel: 'Next',
        prevTriggerLabel: 'Prev',
        itemLabel: (details) => `Page ${details.page}`,
      }}
      class={styles.Root}
    >
      <div class={styles.Controls}>
        <Pagination.PrevTrigger class={styles.Trigger}>
          <ChevronLeftIcon />
        </Pagination.PrevTrigger>
        <Pagination.Context>
          {(pagination) => (
            <For each={pagination().pages}>
              {(page, index) =>
                page.type === 'page' ? (
                  <Pagination.Item {...page} class={styles.Item}>
                    {page.value}
                  </Pagination.Item>

                    &#8230;
                  </Pagination.Ellipsis>
                )
              }
            </For>
          )}
        </Pagination.Context>
        <Pagination.NextTrigger class={styles.Trigger}>
          <ChevronRightIcon />
        </Pagination.NextTrigger>
      </div>
    </Pagination.Root>
  )
}

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { ChevronLeft, ChevronRight } from 'lucide-vue-next'
import { Pagination } from '@ark-ui/vue/pagination'
import styles from 'styles/pagination.module.css'
</script>

<template>
  <Pagination.Root
    :count="5000"
    :page-size="20"

      prevTriggerLabel: 'Prev',
      itemLabel: (details) => `Page ${details.page}`,
    }"
    :class="styles.Root"

          <Pagination.Item v-if="page.type === 'page'" v-bind="page" :class="styles.Item">
            {{ page.value }}
          </Pagination.Item>
          <Pagination.Ellipsis v-else :index="index" :class="styles.Ellipsis">&#8230;</Pagination.Ellipsis>
        </template>
      </Pagination.Context>
      <Pagination.NextTrigger :class="styles.Trigger">
        <ChevronRight />
      </Pagination.NextTrigger>
    </div>
  </Pagination.Root>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { ChevronLeft, ChevronRight } from 'lucide-svelte'
  import { Pagination } from '@ark-ui/svelte/pagination'
  import styles from 'styles/pagination.module.css'
</script>

<Pagination.Root
  count={5000}
  pageSize={20}
  siblingCount={3}
  translations={{
    nextTriggerLabel: 'Next',
    prevTriggerLabel: 'Prev',
    itemLabel: (details) => `Page ${details.page}`,
  }}
  class={styles.Root}
>
  <div class={styles.Controls}>
    <Pagination.PrevTrigger class={styles.Trigger}>
      <ChevronLeft />
    </Pagination.PrevTrigger>
    <Pagination.Context>
      {#snippet render(pagination)}
        {#each pagination().pages as page, index (index)}
          {#if page.type === 'page'}
            <Pagination.Item {...page} class={styles.Item}>
              {page.value}
            </Pagination.Item>
          {:else}
            <Pagination.Ellipsis {index} class={styles.Ellipsis}>&#8230;</Pagination.Ellipsis>
          {/if}
        {/each}
      {/snippet}
    </Pagination.Context>
    <Pagination.NextTrigger class={styles.Trigger}>
      <ChevronRight />
    </Pagination.NextTrigger>
  </div>
</Pagination.Root>

```

### Context

The `Context` component provides access to the pagination state and methods through a render prop pattern. This allows
you to access methods like `setPage`, `setPageSize`, `goToNextPage`, `goToPrevPage`, `goToFirstPage`, `goToLastPage`, as
well as properties like `totalPages` and `pageRange`.

**Example: context**

#### React

```tsx
import { ChevronLeftIcon, ChevronRightIcon, ChevronsLeftIcon, ChevronsRightIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import { Pagination } from '@ark-ui/react/pagination'
import styles from 'styles/pagination.module.css'

export const Context = () => {
  return (
    <Pagination.Root count={100} pageSize={10} className={styles.Root}>
      <Pagination.Context>
        {(pagination) => (
          <div className={styles.Controls}>
            <button className={styles.Trigger} onClick={() => pagination.goToFirstPage()}>
              <ChevronsLeftIcon />
            </button>
            <button className={styles.Trigger} onClick={() => pagination.goToPrevPage()}>
              <ChevronLeftIcon />
            </button>
            <p className={styles.Text} style={{ minWidth: '120px', textAlign: 'center' }}>
              Page {pagination.page} of {pagination.totalPages}
            </p>
            <button className={styles.Trigger} onClick={() => pagination.goToNextPage()}>
              <ChevronRightIcon />
            </button>
            <button className={styles.Trigger} onClick={() => pagination.goToLastPage()}>
              <ChevronsRightIcon />
            </button>
          </div>
        )}
      </Pagination.Context>
    </Pagination.Root>
  )
}

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { ChevronLeftIcon, ChevronRightIcon, ChevronsLeftIcon, ChevronsRightIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { Pagination } from '@ark-ui/solid/pagination'
import styles from 'styles/pagination.module.css'

export const Context = () => {
  return (
    <Pagination.Root count={100} pageSize={10} class={styles.Root}>
      <Pagination.Context>
        {(pagination) => (
          <div class={styles.Controls}>
            <button class={styles.Trigger} onClick={() => pagination().goToFirstPage()}>
              <ChevronsLeftIcon />
            </button>
            <button class={styles.Trigger} onClick={() => pagination().goToPrevPage()}>
              <ChevronLeftIcon />
            </button>
            <p class={styles.Text} style={{ 'min-width': '120px', 'text-align': 'center' }}>
              Page {pagination().page} of {pagination().totalPages}
            </p>
            <button class={styles.Trigger} onClick={() => pagination().goToNextPage()}>
              <ChevronRightIcon />

        )}
      </Pagination.Context>
    </Pagination.Root>
  )
}

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { ChevronLeft, ChevronRight, ChevronsLeft, ChevronsRight } from 'lucide-vue-next'

### Data Slicing

Use the `slice()` method to paginate actual data arrays. This method automatically slices your data based on the current
page and page size.

**Example: data-slicing**

#### React

```tsx
import { ChevronLeftIcon, ChevronRightIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import { Pagination } from '@ark-ui/react/pagination'
import styles from 'styles/pagination.module.css'

const users = [
  { id: 1, name: 'Emma Wilson', email: 'emma@example.com' },
  { id: 2, name: 'Liam Johnson', email: 'liam@example.com' },
  { id: 3, name: 'Olivia Brown', email: 'olivia@example.com' },
  { id: 4, name: 'Noah Davis', email: 'noah@example.com' },
  { id: 5, name: 'Ava Martinez', email: 'ava@example.com' },
  { id: 6, name: 'Ethan Garcia', email: 'ethan@example.com' },
  { id: 7, name: 'Sophia Rodriguez', email: 'sophia@example.com' },
  { id: 8, name: 'Mason Lee', email: 'mason@example.com' },
  { id: 9, name: 'Isabella Walker', email: 'isabella@example.com' },
  { id: 10, name: 'James Hall', email: 'james@example.com' },
  { id: 11, name: 'Mia Allen', email: 'mia@example.com' },
  { id: 12, name: 'Benjamin Young', email: 'benjamin@example.com' },
  { id: 13, name: 'Charlotte King', email: 'charlotte@example.com' },
  { id: 14, name: 'William Wright', email: 'william@example.com' },
  { id: 15, name: 'Amelia Scott', email: 'amelia@example.com' },

  { id: 19, name: 'Evelyn Nelson', email: 'evelyn@example.com' },
  { id: 20, name: 'Jack Carter', email: 'jack@example.com' },
]

export const DataSlicing = () => {
  return (
    <Pagination.Root count={users.length} pageSize={5} className={styles.Root}>
      <Pagination.Context>
        {(pagination) => (
          <>
            <div className={styles.Grid}>
              {pagination.slice(users).map((user) => (

                  <span className={styles.GridItemText}>{user.email}</span>
                </div>
              ))}
            </div>

            <div className={styles.Controls}>
              <Pagination.PrevTrigger className={styles.Trigger}>
                <ChevronLeftIcon />
              </Pagination.PrevTrigger>

              {pagination.pages.map((page, index) =>
                page.type === 'page' ? (
                  <Pagination.Item key={index} {...page} className={styles.Item}>

                    &#8230;
                  </Pagination.Ellipsis>
                ),
              )}

              <Pagination.NextTrigger className={styles.Trigger}>
                <ChevronRightIcon />
              </Pagination.NextTrigger>
            </div>
          </>
        )}
      </Pagination.Context>
    </Pagination.Root>
  )
}

```

### Page Range

Display the current page range information using the `pageRange` property. This shows which items are currently visible
(e.g., "Showing 1-10 of 100 results").

**Example: page-range**

### Page Size

Control the number of items per page dynamically using `setPageSize()`. This example shows how to integrate a native
select element to change the page size.

> **Note:** For uncontrolled behavior, use `defaultPageSize` to set the initial value. For controlled behavior, use
> `pageSize` and `onPageSizeChange` to programmatically manage the page size.

**Example: page-size-control**

```tsx

### Links

Create pagination with link navigation for better SEO and accessibility. This example shows how to use the pagination
component with anchor links instead of buttons.

**Example: link**

#### React

```tsx
import { ChevronLeftIcon, ChevronRightIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import { Pagination, usePagination } from '@ark-ui/react/pagination'
import styles from 'styles/pagination.module.css'

export const Link = () => {
  const pagination = usePagination({
    type: 'link',
    count: 100,
    pageSize: 10,
    siblingCount: 2,
    getPageUrl: ({ page }) => `/page=${page}`,
  })

  return (
    <Pagination.RootProvider value={pagination} className={styles.Root}>
      <div className={styles.Controls}>
        <a className={styles.Trigger} {...pagination.getPrevTriggerProps()}>
          <ChevronLeftIcon />
        </a>
        {pagination.pages.map((page, index) =>
          page.type === 'page' ? (
            <a key={index} className={styles.Item} {...pagination.getItemProps(page)}>
              {page.value}
            </a>
          ) : (
            <span key={index} className={styles.Ellipsis} {...pagination.getEllipsisProps({ index })}>
              &#8230;
            </span>
          ),
        )}
        <a className={styles.Trigger} {...pagination.getNextTriggerProps()}>
          <ChevronRightIcon />
        </a>
      </div>
    </Pagination.RootProvider>
  )
}

```

```

### Autocomplete

Use the `autoComplete` prop to manage autocompletion in the input.

- `new-password` — The user is creating a new password.
- `current-password` — The user is entering an existing password.

**Example: autocomplete**

#### React

```tsx
import { PasswordInput } from '@ark-ui/react/password-input'
import { EyeIcon, EyeOffIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import styles from 'styles/password-input.module.css'

export const Autocomplete = () => (
  <PasswordInput.Root className={styles.Root} autoComplete="new-password">
    <PasswordInput.Label className={styles.Label}>Password</PasswordInput.Label>
    <PasswordInput.Control className={styles.Control}>
      <PasswordInput.Input className={styles.Input} />
      <PasswordInput.VisibilityTrigger className={styles.VisibilityTrigger}>
        <PasswordInput.Indicator className={styles.Indicator} fallback={<EyeOffIcon />}>
          <EyeIcon />
        </PasswordInput.Indicator>
      </PasswordInput.VisibilityTrigger>
    </PasswordInput.Control>
  </PasswordInput.Root>
)

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { PasswordInput } from '@ark-ui/solid/password-input'
import { EyeIcon, EyeOffIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import styles from 'styles/password-input.module.css'

export const Autocomplete = () => (
  <PasswordInput.Root class={styles.Root} autoComplete="new-password">
    <PasswordInput.Label class={styles.Label}>Password</PasswordInput.Label>
    <PasswordInput.Control class={styles.Control}>
      <PasswordInput.Input class={styles.Input} />
      <PasswordInput.VisibilityTrigger class={styles.VisibilityTrigger}>
        <PasswordInput.Indicator class={styles.Indicator} fallback={<EyeOffIcon />}>
          <EyeIcon />
        </PasswordInput.Indicator>
      </PasswordInput.VisibilityTrigger>
    </PasswordInput.Control>
  </PasswordInput.Root>
)

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { PasswordInput } from '@ark-ui/vue/password-input'
import { EyeIcon, EyeOffIcon } from 'lucide-vue-next'
import styles from 'styles/password-input.module.css'
</script>

<template>
  <PasswordInput.Root :class="styles.Root" autoComplete="new-password">
    <PasswordInput.Label :class="styles.Label">Password</PasswordInput.Label>
    <PasswordInput.Control :class="styles.Control">
      <PasswordInput.Input :class="styles.Input" />
      <PasswordInput.VisibilityTrigger :class="styles.VisibilityTrigger">
        <PasswordInput.Indicator :class="styles.Indicator">
          <EyeIcon />
          <template #fallback>
            <EyeOffIcon />
          </template>
        </PasswordInput.Indicator>
      </PasswordInput.VisibilityTrigger>
    </PasswordInput.Control>
  </PasswordInput.Root>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { PasswordInput } from '@ark-ui/svelte/password-input'
  import { EyeIcon, EyeOffIcon } from 'lucide-svelte'
  import styles from 'styles/password-input.module.css'
</script>

<PasswordInput.Root class={styles.Root} autoComplete="new-password">
  <PasswordInput.Label class={styles.Label}>Password</PasswordInput.Label>
  <PasswordInput.Control class={styles.Control}>
    <PasswordInput.Input class={styles.Input} />
    <PasswordInput.VisibilityTrigger class={styles.VisibilityTrigger}>
      <PasswordInput.Indicator class={styles.Indicator}>
        {#snippet fallback()}
          <EyeOffIcon />
        {/snippet}
        <EyeIcon />
      </PasswordInput.Indicator>
    </PasswordInput.VisibilityTrigger>
  </PasswordInput.Control>
</PasswordInput.Root>

```

### Controlled Visibility

Use the `visible` and `onVisibilityChange` props to control the visibility of the password input.

**Example: controlled-visibility**

#### React

```tsx
import { PasswordInput } from '@ark-ui/react/password-input'
import { EyeIcon, EyeOffIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import { useState } from 'react'
import styles from 'styles/password-input.module.css'

export const ControlledVisibility = () => {
  const [visible, setVisible] = useState(false)
  return (
    <PasswordInput.Root className={styles.Root} visible={visible} onVisibilityChange={(e) => setVisible(e.visible)}>
      <PasswordInput.Label className={styles.Label}>Password is {visible ? 'visible' : 'hidden'}</PasswordInput.Label>
      <PasswordInput.Control className={styles.Control}>
        <PasswordInput.Input className={styles.Input} />
        <PasswordInput.VisibilityTrigger className={styles.VisibilityTrigger}>
          <PasswordInput.Indicator className={styles.Indicator} fallback={<EyeOffIcon />}>
            <EyeIcon />
          </PasswordInput.Indicator>
        </PasswordInput.VisibilityTrigger>
      </PasswordInput.Control>
    </PasswordInput.Root>
  )
}

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { PasswordInput } from '@ark-ui/solid/password-input'
import { EyeIcon, EyeOffIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { createSignal } from 'solid-js'
import styles from 'styles/password-input.module.css'

export const ControlledVisibility = () => {
  const [visible, setVisible] = createSignal(false)
  return (
    <PasswordInput.Root class={styles.Root} visible={visible()} onVisibilityChange={(e) => setVisible(e.visible)}>
      <PasswordInput.Label class={styles.Label}>Password is {visible() ? 'visible' : 'hidden'}</PasswordInput.Label>
      <PasswordInput.Control class={styles.Control}>
        <PasswordInput.Input class={styles.Input} />
        <PasswordInput.VisibilityTrigger class={styles.VisibilityTrigger}>
          <PasswordInput.Indicator class={styles.Indicator} fallback={<EyeOffIcon />}>
            <EyeIcon />
          </PasswordInput.Indicator>
        </PasswordInput.VisibilityTrigger>
      </PasswordInput.Control>
    </PasswordInput.Root>
  )
}

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { PasswordInput } from '@ark-ui/vue/password-input'
import { EyeIcon, EyeOffIcon } from 'lucide-vue-next'
import { ref } from 'vue'
import styles from 'styles/password-input.module.css'

const visible = ref(false)
</script>

<template>
  <PasswordInput.Root :class="styles.Root" v-model:visible="visible">
    <PasswordInput.Label :class="styles.Label">Password is {{ visible ? 'visible' : 'hidden' }}</PasswordInput.Label>
    <PasswordInput.Control :class="styles.Control">
      <PasswordInput.Input :class="styles.Input" />
      <PasswordInput.VisibilityTrigger :class="styles.VisibilityTrigger">
        <PasswordInput.Indicator :class="styles.Indicator">
          <EyeIcon />
          <template #fallback>
            <EyeOffIcon />
          </template>
        </PasswordInput.Indicator>
      </PasswordInput.VisibilityTrigger>
    </PasswordInput.Control>
  </PasswordInput.Root>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { PasswordInput } from '@ark-ui/svelte/password-input'
  import { EyeIcon, EyeOffIcon } from 'lucide-svelte'
  import styles from 'styles/password-input.module.css'

  let visible = $state(false)
</script>

<PasswordInput.Root class={styles.Root} bind:visible>
  <PasswordInput.Label class={styles.Label}>
    Password is {visible ? 'visible' : 'hidden'}
  </PasswordInput.Label>
  <PasswordInput.Control class={styles.Control}>
    <PasswordInput.Input class={styles.Input} />
    <PasswordInput.VisibilityTrigger class={styles.VisibilityTrigger}>
      <PasswordInput.Indicator class={styles.Indicator}>
        {#snippet fallback()}
          <EyeOffIcon />
        {/snippet}
        <EyeIcon />
      </PasswordInput.Indicator>
    </PasswordInput.VisibilityTrigger>
  </PasswordInput.Control>
</PasswordInput.Root>

```

### Root Provider

An alternative way to control the password input is to use the `RootProvider` component and the `usePasswordInput` hook.
This way you can access the state and methods from outside the component.

**Example: root-provider**

#### React

```tsx
import { PasswordInput, usePasswordInput } from '@ark-ui/react/password-input'
import { EyeIcon, EyeOffIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import styles from 'styles/password-input.module.css'

export const RootProvider = () => {
  const passwordInput = usePasswordInput()

  return (
    <div className="stack">
      <output>password input is {passwordInput.visible ? 'visible' : 'hidden'}</output>
      <PasswordInput.RootProvider className={styles.Root} value={passwordInput}>
        <PasswordInput.Label className={styles.Label}>Password</PasswordInput.Label>
        <PasswordInput.Control className={styles.Control}>
          <PasswordInput.Input className={styles.Input} />
          <PasswordInput.VisibilityTrigger className={styles.VisibilityTrigger}>
            <PasswordInput.Indicator className={styles.Indicator} fallback={<EyeOffIcon />}>
              <EyeIcon />
            </PasswordInput.Indicator>
          </PasswordInput.VisibilityTrigger>
        </PasswordInput.Control>
      </PasswordInput.RootProvider>
    </div>
  )
}

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { PasswordInput, usePasswordInput } from '@ark-ui/solid/password-input'
import { EyeIcon, EyeOffIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import styles from 'styles/password-input.module.css'

export const RootProvider = () => {
  const passwordInput = usePasswordInput()

  return (
    <div class="stack">
      <output>password input is {passwordInput().visible ? 'visible' : 'hidden'}</output>
      <PasswordInput.RootProvider class={styles.Root} value={passwordInput}>
        <PasswordInput.Label class={styles.Label}>Password</PasswordInput.Label>
        <PasswordInput.Control class={styles.Control}>
          <PasswordInput.Input class={styles.Input} />
          <PasswordInput.VisibilityTrigger class={styles.VisibilityTrigger}>
            <PasswordInput.Indicator class={styles.Indicator} fallback={<EyeOffIcon />}>
              <EyeIcon />
            </PasswordInput.Indicator>
          </PasswordInput.VisibilityTrigger>
        </PasswordInput.Control>
      </PasswordInput.RootProvider>
    </div>
  )
}

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { PasswordInput, usePasswordInput } from '@ark-ui/vue/password-input'
import { EyeIcon, EyeOffIcon } from 'lucide-vue-next'
import styles from 'styles/password-input.module.css'

const passwordInput = usePasswordInput()
</script>

<template>
  <div class="stack">
    <output>password input is {{ passwordInput.visible ? 'visible' : 'hidden' }}</output>
    <PasswordInput.RootProvider :class="styles.Root" :value="passwordInput">
      <PasswordInput.Label :class="styles.Label">Password</PasswordInput.Label>
      <PasswordInput.Control :class="styles.Control">
        <PasswordInput.Input :class="styles.Input" />
        <PasswordInput.VisibilityTrigger :class="styles.VisibilityTrigger">
          <PasswordInput.Indicator :class="styles.Indicator">
            <EyeIcon />
            <template #fallback>
              <EyeOffIcon />
            </template>
          </PasswordInput.Indicator>
        </PasswordInput.VisibilityTrigger>
      </PasswordInput.Control>
    </PasswordInput.RootProvider>
  </div>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { PasswordInput, usePasswordInput } from '@ark-ui/svelte/password-input'
  import { EyeIcon, EyeOffIcon } from 'lucide-svelte'
  import styles from 'styles/password-input.module.css'

  const id = $props.id()

  const passwordInput = usePasswordInput({ id })
</script>

<div class="stack">
  <output>password input is {passwordInput().visible ? 'visible' : 'hidden'}</output>
  <PasswordInput.RootProvider class={styles.Root} value={passwordInput}>
    <PasswordInput.Label class={styles.Label}>Password</PasswordInput.Label>
    <PasswordInput.Control class={styles.Control}>
      <PasswordInput.Input class={styles.Input} />
      <PasswordInput.VisibilityTrigger class={styles.VisibilityTrigger}>
        <PasswordInput.Indicator class={styles.Indicator}>
          {#snippet fallback()}
            <EyeOffIcon />
          {/snippet}
          <EyeIcon />
        </PasswordInput.Indicator>
      </PasswordInput.VisibilityTrigger>
    </PasswordInput.Control>
  </PasswordInput.RootProvider>
</div>

```

### Field

Here's an example of how to use the `PasswordInput` component with the `Field` component.

**Example: with-field**

#### React

```tsx
import { Field } from '@ark-ui/react/field'
import { PasswordInput } from '@ark-ui/react/password-input'
import { EyeIcon, EyeOffIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import field from 'styles/field.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/password-input.module.css'

export const WithField = () => (
  <Field.Root className={field.Root}>
    <PasswordInput.Root className={styles.Root}>
      <PasswordInput.Label className={styles.Label}>Password</PasswordInput.Label>
      <PasswordInput.Control className={styles.Control}>
        <PasswordInput.Input className={styles.Input} />
        <PasswordInput.VisibilityTrigger className={styles.VisibilityTrigger}>
          <PasswordInput.Indicator className={styles.Indicator} fallback={<EyeOffIcon />}>
            <EyeIcon />
          </PasswordInput.Indicator>
        </PasswordInput.VisibilityTrigger>
      </PasswordInput.Control>
    </PasswordInput.Root>
    <Field.HelperText className={field.HelperText}>Enter your password</Field.HelperText>
    <Field.ErrorText className={field.ErrorText}>Password is required</Field.ErrorText>
  </Field.Root>
)

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Field } from '@ark-ui/solid/field'
import { PasswordInput } from '@ark-ui/solid/password-input'
import { EyeIcon, EyeOffIcon } from 'lucide-solid'

            <EyeIcon />
          </PasswordInput.Indicator>
        </PasswordInput.VisibilityTrigger>
      </PasswordInput.Control>
    </PasswordInput.Root>
    <Field.HelperText class={field.HelperText}>Enter your password</Field.HelperText>
    <Field.ErrorText class={field.ErrorText}>Password is required</Field.ErrorText>
  </Field.Root>
)

```

#### Vue

import { EyeIcon, EyeOffIcon } from 'lucide-vue-next'
import field from 'styles/field.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/password-input.module.css'

  <Field.HelperText class={field.HelperText}>Enter your password</Field.HelperText>
  <Field.ErrorText class={field.ErrorText}>Password is required</Field.ErrorText>
</Field.Root>

```

### Password Managers

Use the `ignorePasswordManager` prop to ignore password managers like 1Password, LastPass, etc. This is useful for
non-login scenarios (e.g., "api keys", "secure notes", "temporary passwords")

> **Currently, this only works for 1Password, LastPass, Bitwarden, Dashlane, and Proton Pass.**

**Example: ignore-password-manager**

#### React

```tsx
import { PasswordInput } from '@ark-ui/react/password-input'
import { EyeIcon, EyeOffIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import styles from 'styles/password-input.module.css'

export const IgnorePasswordManager = () => (
  <PasswordInput.Root className={styles.Root} ignorePasswordManagers>
    <PasswordInput.Label className={styles.Label}>API Key</PasswordInput.Label>
    <PasswordInput.Control className={styles.Control}>
      <PasswordInput.Input className={styles.Input} defaultValue="spd_1234567890" />
      <PasswordInput.VisibilityTrigger className={styles.VisibilityTrigger}>
        <PasswordInput.Indicator className={styles.Indicator} fallback={<EyeOffIcon />}>
          <EyeIcon />
        </PasswordInput.Indicator>
      </PasswordInput.VisibilityTrigger>
    </PasswordInput.Control>
  </PasswordInput.Root>
)

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { PasswordInput } from '@ark-ui/solid/password-input'
import { EyeIcon, EyeOffIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import styles from 'styles/password-input.module.css'

export const IgnorePasswordManager = () => (
  <PasswordInput.Root class={styles.Root} ignorePasswordManagers>
    <PasswordInput.Label class={styles.Label}>API Key</PasswordInput.Label>
    <PasswordInput.Control class={styles.Control}>
      <PasswordInput.Input class={styles.Input} value="spd_1234567890" />
      <PasswordInput.VisibilityTrigger class={styles.VisibilityTrigger}>
        <PasswordInput.Indicator class={styles.Indicator} fallback={<EyeOffIcon />}>
          <EyeIcon />
        </PasswordInput.Indicator>
      </PasswordInput.VisibilityTrigger>
    </PasswordInput.Control>
  </PasswordInput.Root>
)

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { PasswordInput } from '@ark-ui/vue/password-input'
import { EyeIcon, EyeOffIcon } from 'lucide-vue-next'
import styles from 'styles/password-input.module.css'
</script>

<template>
  <PasswordInput.Root :class="styles.Root" ignorePasswordManagers>
    <PasswordInput.Label :class="styles.Label">API Key</PasswordInput.Label>

### Strength Meter

Combine the `PasswordInput` with a password strength library to show visual feedback about password strength. This
example uses the [`check-password-strength`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/check-password-strength) package to provide
real-time strength validation.

**Example: strength-meter**

#### React

```tsx
import { PasswordInput } from '@ark-ui/react/password-input'
import { passwordStrength, type Options } from 'check-password-strength'
import { EyeIcon, EyeOffIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import { useMemo, useState } from 'react'
import styles from 'styles/password-input.module.css'

const strengthOptions: Options<string> = [
  { id: 0, value: 'weak', minDiversity: 0, minLength: 0 },
  { id: 1, value: 'medium', minDiversity: 2, minLength: 6 },
  { id: 2, value: 'strong', minDiversity: 4, minLength: 8 },
]

export const StrengthMeter = () => {
  const [password, setPassword] = useState('asdfasdf')

  const strength = useMemo(() => {
    if (!password) return null
    const { value } = passwordStrength(password, strengthOptions)
    return value
  }, [password])

  return (
    <PasswordInput.Root className={styles.Root}>
      <PasswordInput.Label className={styles.Label}>Password</PasswordInput.Label>
      <PasswordInput.Control className={styles.Control}>
        <PasswordInput.Input
          className={styles.Input}
          value={password}
          onChange={(e) => setPassword(e.currentTarget.value)}
          placeholder="Enter your password"
        />
        <PasswordInput.VisibilityTrigger className={styles.VisibilityTrigger}>
          <PasswordInput.Indicator className={styles.Indicator} fallback={<EyeOffIcon />}>
            <EyeIcon />
          </PasswordInput.Indicator>
        </PasswordInput.VisibilityTrigger>
      </PasswordInput.Control>
      {strength && (
        <div className={styles.StrengthMeter}>
          <div className={styles.StrengthBar}>
            <div className={styles.StrengthFill} data-strength={strength} />
          </div>
          <div className={styles.StrengthLabel}>{strength} password</div>
        </div>
      )}
    </PasswordInput.Root>
  )
}

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { PasswordInput } from '@ark-ui/solid/password-input'
import { passwordStrength, type Options } from 'check-password-strength'

  { id: 2, value: 'strong', minDiversity: 4, minLength: 8 },
]

export const StrengthMeter = () => {
  const [password, setPassword] = createSignal('asdfasdf')

  const strength = createMemo(() => {
    if (!password()) return null
    const { value } = passwordStrength(password(), strengthOptions)
    return value
  })

  return (
    <PasswordInput.Root class={styles.Root}>

      </PasswordInput.Control>
      <Show when={strength()}>
        {(value) => (

            </div>
            <div class={styles.StrengthLabel}>{value()} password</div>
          </div>
        )}
      </Show>
    </PasswordInput.Root>
  )
}

```

const strength = computed(() => {
  if (!password.value) return null
  const { value } = passwordStrength(password.value, strengthOptions)
  return value
})
</script>

### Validation

Combine with custom validation logic to show real-time feedback. Use the `invalid` prop to indicate validation errors.

**Example: with-validation**

#### React

```tsx
import { PasswordInput } from '@ark-ui/react/password-input'
import { EyeIcon, EyeOffIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import { useMemo, useState } from 'react'
import styles from 'styles/password-input.module.css'

export const WithValidation = () => {
  const [password, setPassword] = useState('')
  const isValid = useMemo(() => password.length >= 8, [password])

  return (
    <PasswordInput.Root className={styles.Root} invalid={!isValid && password.length > 0}>
      <PasswordInput.Label className={styles.Label}>Password (min 8 characters)</PasswordInput.Label>
      <PasswordInput.Control className={styles.Control}>
        <PasswordInput.Input
          className={styles.Input}
          value={password}
          onChange={(e) => setPassword(e.target.value)}
          placeholder="Enter your password"
        />
        <PasswordInput.VisibilityTrigger className={styles.VisibilityTrigger}>
          <PasswordInput.Indicator className={styles.Indicator} fallback={<EyeOffIcon />}>
            <EyeIcon />
          </PasswordInput.Indicator>
        </PasswordInput.VisibilityTrigger>
      </PasswordInput.Control>
      {password.length > 0 && !isValid && (
        <p className={styles.ValidationMessage} data-valid="false">
          Password must be at least 8 characters
        </p>
      )}
      {isValid && password.length > 0 && (
        <p className={styles.ValidationMessage} data-valid="true">
          Password is valid

# Pin Input



## Anatomy



```tsx
<PinInput.Root>
  <PinInput.Label />
  <PinInput.Control>
    <PinInput.Input />
  </PinInput.Control>
  <PinInput.HiddenInput />
</PinInput.Root>
```

## Examples

**Example: basic**

#### React

```tsx
import { PinInput } from '@ark-ui/react/pin-input'
import styles from 'styles/pin-input.module.css'

export const Basic = () => (
  <PinInput.Root className={styles.Root}>
    <PinInput.Label className={styles.Label}>Label</PinInput.Label>
    <PinInput.Control className={styles.Control}>
      {[0, 1, 2].map((id, index) => (
        <PinInput.Input key={id} index={index} className={styles.Input} />
      ))}
    </PinInput.Control>
    <PinInput.HiddenInput />
  </PinInput.Root>
)

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { PinInput } from '@ark-ui/solid/pin-input'
import { Index } from 'solid-js'
import styles from 'styles/pin-input.module.css'

export const Basic = () => (
  <PinInput.Root class={styles.Root}>
    <PinInput.Label class={styles.Label}>Label</PinInput.Label>
    <PinInput.Control class={styles.Control}>
      <Index each={[0, 1, 2]}>{(id) => <PinInput.Input index={id()} class={styles.Input} />}</Index>
    </PinInput.Control>
    <PinInput.HiddenInput />
  </PinInput.Root>
)

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { PinInput } from '@ark-ui/vue/pin-input'
import styles from 'styles/pin-input.module.css'
</script>

<template>
  <PinInput.Root :class="styles.Root">
    <PinInput.Label :class="styles.Label">Label</PinInput.Label>
    <PinInput.Control :class="styles.Control">
      <PinInput.Input v-for="id in [0, 1, 2]" :key="id" :index="id" :class="styles.Input" />
    </PinInput.Control>
    <PinInput.HiddenInput />
  </PinInput.Root>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { PinInput } from '@ark-ui/svelte/pin-input'
  import styles from 'styles/pin-input.module.css'
</script>

<PinInput.Root class={styles.Root}>
  <PinInput.Label class={styles.Label}>Label</PinInput.Label>
  <PinInput.Control class={styles.Control}>
    {#each [0, 1, 2] as id, index (id)}
      <PinInput.Input {index} class={styles.Input} />
    {/each}
  </PinInput.Control>
  <PinInput.HiddenInput />
</PinInput.Root>

```

### Placeholder

To customize the default pin input placeholder `○` for each input, pass the placeholder prop and set it to your desired
value.

**Example: custom-placeholder**

#### React

```tsx
import { PinInput } from '@ark-ui/react/pin-input'
import styles from 'styles/pin-input.module.css'

export const CustomPlaceholder = () => (
  <PinInput.Root className={styles.Root} placeholder="*">
    <PinInput.Label className={styles.Label}>Label</PinInput.Label>
    <PinInput.Control className={styles.Control}>
      {[0, 1, 2].map((id, index) => (
        <PinInput.Input key={id} index={index} className={styles.Input} />
      ))}
    </PinInput.Control>
    <PinInput.HiddenInput />
  </PinInput.Root>
)

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { PinInput } from '@ark-ui/solid/pin-input'
import { Index } from 'solid-js'
import styles from 'styles/pin-input.module.css'

export const CustomPlaceholder = () => (
  <PinInput.Root class={styles.Root} placeholder="*">
    <PinInput.Label class={styles.Label}>Label</PinInput.Label>
    <PinInput.Control class={styles.Control}>
      <Index each={[0, 1, 2]}>{(id) => <PinInput.Input index={id()} class={styles.Input} />}</Index>
    </PinInput.Control>
    <PinInput.HiddenInput />
  </PinInput.Root>
)

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { PinInput } from '@ark-ui/vue/pin-input'
import styles from 'styles/pin-input.module.css'
</script>

<template>
  <PinInput.Root :class="styles.Root" placeholder="*">
    <PinInput.Label :class="styles.Label">Label</PinInput.Label>
    <PinInput.Control :class="styles.Control">
      <PinInput.Input v-for="id in [0, 1, 2]" :key="id" :index="id" :class="styles.Input" />
    </PinInput.Control>
    <PinInput.HiddenInput />
  </PinInput.Root>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { PinInput } from '@ark-ui/svelte/pin-input'
  import styles from 'styles/pin-input.module.css'
</script>

<PinInput.Root class={styles.Root} placeholder="*">
  <PinInput.Label class={styles.Label}>Label</PinInput.Label>
  <PinInput.Control class={styles.Control}>
    {#each [0, 1, 2] as id, index (id)}
      <PinInput.Input {index} class={styles.Input} />
    {/each}
  </PinInput.Control>
  <PinInput.HiddenInput />
</PinInput.Root>

```

### Blur on Complete

By default, the last input maintains focus when filled, and we invoke the `onValueComplete` callback. To blur the last
input when the user completes the input, set the prop `blurOnComplete` to `true`.

**Example: blur-on-complete**

#### React

```tsx
import { PinInput } from '@ark-ui/react/pin-input'
import styles from 'styles/pin-input.module.css'

export const BlurOnComplete = () => (
  <PinInput.Root className={styles.Root} blurOnComplete>
    <PinInput.Label className={styles.Label}>Label</PinInput.Label>
    <PinInput.Control className={styles.Control}>
      {[0, 1, 2].map((id, index) => (
        <PinInput.Input key={id} index={index} className={styles.Input} />
      ))}
    </PinInput.Control>
    <PinInput.HiddenInput />
  </PinInput.Root>
)

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { PinInput } from '@ark-ui/solid/pin-input'
import { Index } from 'solid-js'
import styles from 'styles/pin-input.module.css'

export const BlurOnComplete = () => (
  <PinInput.Root class={styles.Root} blurOnComplete>
    <PinInput.Label class={styles.Label}>Label</PinInput.Label>
    <PinInput.Control class={styles.Control}>
      <Index each={[0, 1, 2]}>{(id) => <PinInput.Input index={id()} class={styles.Input} />}</Index>
    </PinInput.Control>
    <PinInput.HiddenInput />
  </PinInput.Root>
)

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { PinInput } from '@ark-ui/vue/pin-input'
import styles from 'styles/pin-input.module.css'
</script>

<template>
  <PinInput.Root :class="styles.Root" blurOnComplete>
    <PinInput.Label :class="styles.Label">Label</PinInput.Label>
    <PinInput.Control :class="styles.Control">
      <PinInput.Input v-for="id in [0, 1, 2]" :key="id" :index="id" :class="styles.Input" />
    </PinInput.Control>
    <PinInput.HiddenInput />
  </PinInput.Root>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { PinInput } from '@ark-ui/svelte/pin-input'
  import styles from 'styles/pin-input.module.css'
</script>

<PinInput.Root class={styles.Root} blurOnComplete>
  <PinInput.Label class={styles.Label}>Label</PinInput.Label>
  <PinInput.Control class={styles.Control}>
    {#each [0, 1, 2] as id, index (id)}
      <PinInput.Input {index} class={styles.Input} />
    {/each}
  </PinInput.Control>
  <PinInput.HiddenInput />
</PinInput.Root>

```

### OTP Mode

To trigger smartphone OTP auto-suggestion, it is recommended to set the `autocomplete` attribute to "one-time-code". The
pin input component provides support for this automatically when you set the `otp` prop to true.

**Example: otp-mode**

#### React

```tsx
import { PinInput } from '@ark-ui/react/pin-input'
import styles from 'styles/pin-input.module.css'

export const OTPMode = () => (
  <PinInput.Root className={styles.Root} otp>
    <PinInput.Label className={styles.Label}>Label</PinInput.Label>
    <PinInput.Control className={styles.Control}>
      {[0, 1, 2].map((id, index) => (
        <PinInput.Input key={id} index={index} className={styles.Input} />
      ))}
    </PinInput.Control>
    <PinInput.HiddenInput />
  </PinInput.Root>
)

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { PinInput } from '@ark-ui/solid/pin-input'
import { Index } from 'solid-js'
import styles from 'styles/pin-input.module.css'

export const OTPMode = () => (
  <PinInput.Root class={styles.Root} otp>
    <PinInput.Label class={styles.Label}>Label</PinInput.Label>
    <PinInput.Control class={styles.Control}>
      <Index each={[0, 1, 2]}>{(id) => <PinInput.Input index={id()} class={styles.Input} />}</Index>
    </PinInput.Control>
    <PinInput.HiddenInput />
  </PinInput.Root>
)

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { PinInput } from '@ark-ui/vue/pin-input'
import styles from 'styles/pin-input.module.css'
</script>

<template>
  <PinInput.Root :class="styles.Root" otp>
    <PinInput.Label :class="styles.Label">Label</PinInput.Label>
    <PinInput.Control :class="styles.Control">
      <PinInput.Input v-for="id in [0, 1, 2]" :key="id" :index="id" :class="styles.Input" />
    </PinInput.Control>
    <PinInput.HiddenInput />
  </PinInput.Root>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { PinInput } from '@ark-ui/svelte/pin-input'
  import styles from 'styles/pin-input.module.css'
</script>

<PinInput.Root class={styles.Root} otp>
  <PinInput.Label class={styles.Label}>Label</PinInput.Label>
  <PinInput.Control class={styles.Control}>
    {#each [0, 1, 2] as id, index (id)}
      <PinInput.Input {index} class={styles.Input} />
    {/each}
  </PinInput.Control>
  <PinInput.HiddenInput />
</PinInput.Root>

```

### Masking

When collecting private or sensitive information using the pin input, you might need to mask the value entered, similar
to `<input type="password"/>`. Pass the `mask` prop to `true`.

**Example: mask**

#### React

```tsx
import { PinInput } from '@ark-ui/react/pin-input'
import styles from 'styles/pin-input.module.css'

export const Mask = () => (
  <PinInput.Root className={styles.Root} mask>
    <PinInput.Label className={styles.Label}>Label</PinInput.Label>
    <PinInput.Control className={styles.Control}>
      {[0, 1, 2].map((id, index) => (
        <PinInput.Input key={id} index={index} className={styles.Input} />
      ))}
    </PinInput.Control>
    <PinInput.HiddenInput />
  </PinInput.Root>
)

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { PinInput } from '@ark-ui/solid/pin-input'
import { Index } from 'solid-js'
import styles from 'styles/pin-input.module.css'

export const Mask = () => (
  <PinInput.Root class={styles.Root} mask>
    <PinInput.Label class={styles.Label}>Label</PinInput.Label>
    <PinInput.Control class={styles.Control}>
      <Index each={[0, 1, 2]}>{(id) => <PinInput.Input index={id()} class={styles.Input} />}</Index>
    </PinInput.Control>
    <PinInput.HiddenInput />
  </PinInput.Root>
)

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { PinInput } from '@ark-ui/vue/pin-input'
import styles from 'styles/pin-input.module.css'
</script>

<template>
  <PinInput.Root :class="styles.Root" mask>
    <PinInput.Label :class="styles.Label">Label</PinInput.Label>
    <PinInput.Control :class="styles.Control">
      <PinInput.Input v-for="id in [0, 1, 2]" :key="id" :index="id" :class="styles.Input" />
    </PinInput.Control>
    <PinInput.HiddenInput />
  </PinInput.Root>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { PinInput } from '@ark-ui/svelte/pin-input'
  import styles from 'styles/pin-input.module.css'
</script>

<PinInput.Root class={styles.Root} mask>
  <PinInput.Label class={styles.Label}>Label</PinInput.Label>
  <PinInput.Control class={styles.Control}>
    {#each [0, 1, 2] as id, index (id)}
      <PinInput.Input {index} class={styles.Input} />
    {/each}
  </PinInput.Control>
  <PinInput.HiddenInput />
</PinInput.Root>

```

### Change Events

The pin input component invokes several callback functions when the user enters:

- `onValueChange` — Callback invoked when the value is changed.
- `onValueComplete` — Callback invoked when all fields have been completed (by typing or pasting).
- `onValueInvalid` — Callback invoked when an invalid value is entered into the input. An invalid value is any value
  that doesn't match the specified "type".

### Field

The `Field` component helps manage form-related state and accessibility attributes of a pin input. It includes handling
ARIA labels, helper text, and error text to ensure proper accessibility.

**Example: with-field**

#### React

```tsx
import { Field } from '@ark-ui/react/field'
import { PinInput } from '@ark-ui/react/pin-input'
import fieldStyles from 'styles/field.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/pin-input.module.css'

export const WithField = () => (
  <Field.Root className={fieldStyles.Root}>
    <PinInput.Root className={styles.Root}>
      <PinInput.Label className={styles.Label}>Label</PinInput.Label>
      <PinInput.Control className={styles.Control}>
        {[0, 1, 2].map((id, index) => (
          <PinInput.Input key={id} index={index} className={styles.Input} />
        ))}
      </PinInput.Control>

### Root Provider

An alternative way to control the pin input is to use the `RootProvider` component and the `usePinInput` hook. This way
you can access the state and methods from outside the component.

**Example: root-provider**

#### React

```tsx
import { PinInput, usePinInput } from '@ark-ui/react/pin-input'
import styles from 'styles/pin-input.module.css'

export const RootProvider = () => {
  const pinInput = usePinInput({ onValueComplete: (e) => alert(e.valueAsString) })

  return (
    <div className="stack">
      <button onClick={() => pinInput.focus()}>Focus</button>

      <PinInput.RootProvider value={pinInput} className={styles.Root}>
        <PinInput.Label className={styles.Label}>Label</PinInput.Label>
        <PinInput.Control className={styles.Control}>
          {[0, 1, 2].map((id, index) => (
            <PinInput.Input key={id} index={index} className={styles.Input} />
          ))}
        </PinInput.Control>
        <PinInput.HiddenInput />
      </PinInput.RootProvider>
    </div>
  )
}

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { PinInput, usePinInput } from '@ark-ui/solid/pin-input'
import { Index } from 'solid-js'
import styles from 'styles/pin-input.module.css'

export const RootProvider = () => {
  const pinInput = usePinInput({ onValueComplete: (e) => alert(e.valueAsString) })

  return (
    <div class="stack">
      <button onClick={() => pinInput().focus()}>Focus</button>

      <PinInput.RootProvider value={pinInput} class={styles.Root}>
        <PinInput.Label class={styles.Label}>Label</PinInput.Label>
        <PinInput.Control class={styles.Control}>
          <Index each={[0, 1, 2]}>{(id) => <PinInput.Input index={id()} class={styles.Input} />}</Index>
        </PinInput.Control>
        <PinInput.HiddenInput />
      </PinInput.RootProvider>
    </div>
  )
}

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { PinInput, usePinInput } from '@ark-ui/vue/pin-input'
import styles from 'styles/pin-input.module.css'

const pinInput = usePinInput()
</script>

<template>
  <div class="stack">
    <button @click="pinInput.focus()">Focus</button>

    <PinInput.RootProvider :value="pinInput" :class="styles.Root">
      <PinInput.Label :class="styles.Label">Label</PinInput.Label>
      <PinInput.Control :class="styles.Control">
        <PinInput.Input v-for="id in [0, 1, 2]" :key="id" :index="id" :class="styles.Input" />
      </PinInput.Control>
      <PinInput.HiddenInput />
    </PinInput.RootProvider>
  </div>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { PinInput, usePinInput } from '@ark-ui/svelte/pin-input'
  import styles from 'styles/pin-input.module.css'

  const id = $props.id()

  const pinInput = usePinInput({ id, onValueComplete: (e) => alert(e.valueAsString) })
</script>

<div class="stack">
  <button onclick={() => pinInput().focus()}>Focus</button>

  <PinInput.RootProvider value={pinInput} class={styles.Root}>
    <PinInput.Label class={styles.Label}>Label</PinInput.Label>
    <PinInput.Control class={styles.Control}>
      {#each [0, 1, 2] as id, index (id)}
        <PinInput.Input {index} class={styles.Input} />
      {/each}
    </PinInput.Control>
    <PinInput.HiddenInput />
  </PinInput.RootProvider>
</div>

```

```tsx
import { Popover } from '@ark-ui/react/popover'
import { Portal } from '@ark-ui/react/portal'
import { XIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import { useState } from 'react'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/popover.module.css'

export const Controlled = () => {
  const [open, setOpen] = useState(false)
  return (
    <Popover.Root open={open} onOpenChange={(e) => setOpen(e.open)}>
      <Popover.Trigger className={button.Root}>Click Me</Popover.Trigger>
      <Portal>
        <Popover.Positioner className={styles.Positioner}>
          <Popover.Content className={styles.Content}>
            <Popover.CloseTrigger className={styles.CloseTrigger}>
              <XIcon />
            </Popover.CloseTrigger>
            <Popover.Title className={styles.Title}>Team Members</Popover.Title>
            <Popover.Description className={styles.Description}>
              Invite colleagues to collaborate on this project.
            </Popover.Description>
          </Popover.Content>
        </Popover.Positioner>
      </Portal>
    </Popover.Root>
  )
}

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Popover } from '@ark-ui/solid/popover'
import { XIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { createSignal } from 'solid-js'
import { Portal } from 'solid-js/web'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/popover.module.css'

export const Controlled = () => {
  const [open, setOpen] = createSignal(false)
  return (
    <Popover.Root open={open()} onOpenChange={(e) => setOpen(e.open)}>
      <Popover.Trigger class={button.Root}>Click Me</Popover.Trigger>
      <Portal>
        <Popover.Positioner class={styles.Positioner}>
          <Popover.Content class={styles.Content}>
            <Popover.CloseTrigger class={styles.CloseTrigger}>
              <XIcon />
            </Popover.CloseTrigger>
            <Popover.Title class={styles.Title}>Team Members</Popover.Title>
            <Popover.Description class={styles.Description}>
              Invite colleagues to collaborate on this project.
            </Popover.Description>
          </Popover.Content>
        </Popover.Positioner>
      </Portal>
    </Popover.Root>
  )
}

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Popover } from '@ark-ui/vue/popover'
import { XIcon } from 'lucide-vue-next'
import { ref } from 'vue'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/popover.module.css'

const open = ref(false)
</script>

<template>
  <Popover.Root v-model:open="open" portalled>
    <Popover.Trigger :class="button.Root">Click Me</Popover.Trigger>
    <Popover.Positioner :class="styles.Positioner">
      <Popover.Content :class="styles.Content">
        <Popover.CloseTrigger :class="styles.CloseTrigger">
          <XIcon />
        </Popover.CloseTrigger>
        <Popover.Title :class="styles.Title">Team Members</Popover.Title>
        <Popover.Description :class="styles.Description">
          Invite colleagues to collaborate on this project.
        </Popover.Description>
      </Popover.Content>
    </Popover.Positioner>
  </Popover.Root>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Popover } from '@ark-ui/svelte/popover'
  import { Portal } from '@ark-ui/svelte/portal'
  import { XIcon } from 'lucide-svelte'
  import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
  import styles from 'styles/popover.module.css'

  let open = $state(false)
</script>

<Popover.Root bind:open>
  <Popover.Trigger class={button.Root}>Click Me</Popover.Trigger>
  <Portal>
    <Popover.Positioner class={styles.Positioner}>
      <Popover.Content class={styles.Content}>
        <Popover.CloseTrigger class={styles.CloseTrigger}>
          <XIcon />
        </Popover.CloseTrigger>
        <Popover.Title class={styles.Title}>Team Members</Popover.Title>
        <Popover.Description class={styles.Description}>
          Invite colleagues to collaborate on this project.
        </Popover.Description>
      </Popover.Content>
    </Popover.Positioner>
  </Portal>
</Popover.Root>

```

### Root Provider

An alternative way to control the popover is to use the `RootProvider` component and the `usePopover` hook. This way you
can access the state and methods from outside the component.

**Example: root-provider**

#### React

```tsx
import { Popover, usePopover } from '@ark-ui/react/popover'
import { Portal } from '@ark-ui/react/portal'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/popover.module.css'

export const RootProvider = () => {
  const popover = usePopover({
    positioning: {
      placement: 'bottom-start',
    },
  })

  return (
    <div className="stack">
      <button className={button.Root} onClick={() => popover.setOpen(true)}>
        Popover is {popover.open ? 'open' : 'closed'}
      </button>
      <Popover.RootProvider value={popover}>
        <Portal>
          <Popover.Positioner className={styles.Positioner}>
            <Popover.Content className={styles.Content}>
              <Popover.Title className={styles.Title}>Controlled Externally</Popover.Title>
              <Popover.Description className={styles.Description}>
                This popover is controlled via the usePopover hook.
              </Popover.Description>
            </Popover.Content>
          </Popover.Positioner>
        </Portal>
      </Popover.RootProvider>
    </div>
  )
}

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Popover, usePopover } from '@ark-ui/solid/popover'
import { Portal } from 'solid-js/web'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/popover.module.css'

export const RootProvider = () => {
  const popover = usePopover()

  return (
    <div class="stack">
      <button class={button.Root} onClick={() => popover().setOpen(true)}>
        Popover is {popover().open ? 'open' : 'closed'}
      </button>
      <Popover.RootProvider value={popover}>
        <Portal>
          <Popover.Positioner class={styles.Positioner}>
            <Popover.Content class={styles.Content}>
              <Popover.Title class={styles.Title}>Controlled Externally</Popover.Title>
              <Popover.Description class={styles.Description}>
                This popover is controlled via the usePopover hook.
              </Popover.Description>
            </Popover.Content>
          </Popover.Positioner>
        </Portal>
      </Popover.RootProvider>
    </div>
  )
}

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Popover, usePopover } from '@ark-ui/vue/popover'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/popover.module.css'

const popover = usePopover({
  positioning: {
    placement: 'bottom-start',
  },
})
</script>

<template>
  <div class="stack">
    <button :class="button.Root" @click="popover.setOpen(true)">
      Popover is {{ popover.open ? 'open' : 'closed' }}
    </button>

    <Popover.RootProvider :value="popover" portalled>
      <Popover.Positioner :class="styles.Positioner">
        <Popover.Content :class="styles.Content">
          <Popover.Title :class="styles.Title">Controlled Externally</Popover.Title>
          <Popover.Description :class="styles.Description">
            This popover is controlled via the usePopover hook.
          </Popover.Description>
        </Popover.Content>
      </Popover.Positioner>
    </Popover.RootProvider>
  </div>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Popover, usePopover } from '@ark-ui/svelte/popover'
  import { Portal } from '@ark-ui/svelte/portal'
  import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
  import styles from 'styles/popover.module.css'

  const popover = usePopover({
    positioning: {
      placement: 'bottom-start',
    },
  })
</script>

<div class="stack">
  <button class={button.Root} onclick={() => popover().setOpen(true)}>
    Popover is {popover().open ? 'open' : 'closed'}
  </button>

  <Popover.RootProvider value={popover}>
    <Portal>
      <Popover.Positioner class={styles.Positioner}>
        <Popover.Content class={styles.Content}>
          <Popover.Title class={styles.Title}>Controlled Externally</Popover.Title>

        </Popover.Content>
      </Popover.Positioner>
    </Portal>
  </Popover.RootProvider>
</div>

```

### Arrow

**Example: arrow**

#### React

```tsx
import { Popover } from '@ark-ui/react/popover'
import { Portal } from '@ark-ui/react/portal'

    <Portal>
      <Popover.Positioner className={styles.Positioner}>
        <Popover.Content className={styles.Content}>
          <Popover.Arrow className={styles.Arrow}>
            <Popover.ArrowTip className={styles.ArrowTip} />
          </Popover.Arrow>
          <Popover.CloseTrigger className={styles.CloseTrigger}>
            <XIcon />
          </Popover.CloseTrigger>
          <Popover.Title className={styles.Title}>Notifications</Popover.Title>
          <Popover.Description className={styles.Description}>
            You have 3 unread messages in your inbox.
          </Popover.Description>

      </Popover.Content>
    </Popover.Positioner>
  </Portal>
</Popover.Root>

```

### Close Behavior

The popover is designed to close on blur and when the <kbd>esc</kbd> key is pressed.

- To prevent it from closing on blur (clicking or focusing outside), pass the `closeOnInteractOutside` prop and set it
  to `false`.
- To prevent it from closing when the <kbd>esc</kbd> key is pressed, pass the `closeOnEsc` prop and set it to `false`.

**Example: close-behavior**

        </Popover.Description>
      </Popover.Content>
    </Popover.Positioner>
  </Portal>
</Popover.Root>

```

### Modality

In some cases, you might want the popover to be modal. This means that it'll:

- trap focus within its content
- block scrolling on the body
- disable pointer interactions outside the popover
- hide content behind the popover from screen readers

To make the popover modal, set the `modal` prop to `true`. When `modal={true}`, we set the `portalled` attribute to
`true` as well.

**Example: modal**

#### React

```tsx
import { Popover } from '@ark-ui/react/popover'
import { Portal } from '@ark-ui/react/portal'
import { XIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/popover.module.css'

export const Modal = () => (
  <Popover.Root modal>
    <Popover.Trigger className={button.Root}>Click Me</Popover.Trigger>
    <Portal>
      <Popover.Positioner className={styles.Positioner}>
        <Popover.Content className={styles.Content}>
          <Popover.CloseTrigger className={styles.CloseTrigger}>
            <XIcon />
          </Popover.CloseTrigger>
          <Popover.Title className={styles.Title}>Confirm Action</Popover.Title>
          <Popover.Description className={styles.Description}>
            Focus is trapped inside this modal popover until dismissed.
          </Popover.Description>
        </Popover.Content>
      </Popover.Positioner>
    </Portal>
  </Popover.Root>
)

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Popover } from '@ark-ui/solid/popover'
import { XIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { Portal } from 'solid-js/web'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/popover.module.css'

export const Modal = () => (
  <Popover.Root modal>
    <Popover.Trigger class={button.Root}>Click Me</Popover.Trigger>
    <Portal>
      <Popover.Positioner class={styles.Positioner}>
        <Popover.Content class={styles.Content}>
          <Popover.CloseTrigger class={styles.CloseTrigger}>
            <XIcon />
          </Popover.CloseTrigger>
          <Popover.Title class={styles.Title}>Confirm Action</Popover.Title>
          <Popover.Description class={styles.Description}>
            Focus is trapped inside this modal popover until dismissed.
          </Popover.Description>
        </Popover.Content>
      </Popover.Positioner>
    </Portal>
  </Popover.Root>
)

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Popover } from '@ark-ui/vue/popover'
import { XIcon } from 'lucide-vue-next'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/popover.module.css'
</script>

<template>
  <Popover.Root modal portalled>
    <Popover.Trigger :class="button.Root">Click Me</Popover.Trigger>
    <Popover.Positioner :class="styles.Positioner">
      <Popover.Content :class="styles.Content">
        <Popover.CloseTrigger :class="styles.CloseTrigger">
          <XIcon />
        </Popover.CloseTrigger>
        <Popover.Title :class="styles.Title">Confirm Action</Popover.Title>
        <Popover.Description :class="styles.Description">

        </Popover.Description>
      </Popover.Content>
    </Popover.Positioner>
  </Popover.Root>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Popover } from '@ark-ui/svelte/popover'
  import { Portal } from '@ark-ui/svelte/portal'
  import { XIcon } from 'lucide-svelte'
  import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
  import styles from 'styles/popover.module.css'
</script>

<Popover.Root modal>
  <Popover.Trigger class={button.Root}>Click Me</Popover.Trigger>
  <Portal>
    <Popover.Positioner class={styles.Positioner}>
      <Popover.Content class={styles.Content}>
        <Popover.CloseTrigger class={styles.CloseTrigger}>
          <XIcon />
        </Popover.CloseTrigger>
        <Popover.Title class={styles.Title}>Confirm Action</Popover.Title>
        <Popover.Description class={styles.Description}>
          Focus is trapped inside this modal popover until dismissed.
        </Popover.Description>
      </Popover.Content>
    </Popover.Positioner>
  </Portal>
</Popover.Root>

```

### Anchor

Use `Popover.Anchor` to position the popover relative to a different element than the trigger.

**Example: anchor**

#### React

```tsx
import { Popover } from '@ark-ui/react/popover'
import { XIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import field from 'styles/field.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/popover.module.css'

export const Anchor = () => {
  return (
    <Popover.Root>
      <div className="hstack">
        <Popover.Trigger className={button.Root}>Click Me</Popover.Trigger>
        <Popover.Anchor className={styles.Anchor}>
          <input className={field.Input} placeholder="Type here..." />
        </Popover.Anchor>
      </div>

      <Popover.Positioner className={styles.Positioner}>
        <Popover.Content className={styles.Content}>
          <Popover.CloseTrigger className={styles.CloseTrigger}>
            <XIcon />
          </Popover.CloseTrigger>
          <Popover.Title className={styles.Title}>Title</Popover.Title>
          <Popover.Description className={styles.Description}>Description</Popover.Description>
        </Popover.Content>
      </Popover.Positioner>
    </Popover.Root>
  )
}

```

### Same Width

Use `positioning.sameWidth` to make the popover match the width of its trigger element.

**Example: same-width**

#### React

```tsx
import { Popover } from '@ark-ui/react/popover'
import { Portal } from '@ark-ui/react/portal'
import { XIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/popover.module.css'

export const SameWidth = () => {
  return (
    <Popover.Root positioning={{ sameWidth: true }}>
      <Popover.Trigger className={button.Root} style={{ minWidth: '200px' }}>
        Click Me
      </Popover.Trigger>
      <Portal>
        <Popover.Positioner className={styles.Positioner}>
          <Popover.Content className={styles.Content}>
            <Popover.CloseTrigger className={styles.CloseTrigger}>
              <XIcon />
            </Popover.CloseTrigger>
            <Popover.Title className={styles.Title}>Matched Width</Popover.Title>
            <Popover.Description className={styles.Description}>
              This popover matches the width of its trigger element.
            </Popover.Description>
          </Popover.Content>
        </Popover.Positioner>
      </Portal>
    </Popover.Root>
  )
}

```

### Dialog Integration

When rendering a popover inside a dialog, you have two options for proper layering:

1. **Keep the Portal with `lazyMount` and `unmountOnExit`** - This ensures the popover is properly unmounted when the
   dialog closes, preventing stale DOM nodes.

2. **Remove the Portal** - Render the popover inline within the dialog content. This works well but may have z-index
   considerations.

**Example: with-dialog**

#### React

```tsx
import { Dialog } from '@ark-ui/react/dialog'
import { Popover } from '@ark-ui/react/popover'
import { Portal } from '@ark-ui/react/portal'
import { XIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import dialog from 'styles/dialog.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/popover.module.css'

export const WithDialog = () => (
  <Dialog.Root>
    <Dialog.Trigger className={button.Root}>Open Dialog</Dialog.Trigger>
    <Portal>
      <Dialog.Backdrop className={dialog.Backdrop} />
      <Dialog.Positioner className={dialog.Positioner}>
        <Dialog.Content className={dialog.Content}>
          <Dialog.CloseTrigger className={dialog.CloseTrigger}>
            <XIcon />
          </Dialog.CloseTrigger>
          <Dialog.Title className={dialog.Title}>Edit Profile</Dialog.Title>
          <Dialog.Description className={dialog.Description}>Update your profile information below.</Dialog.Description>
          <div className={dialog.Body}>
            <Popover.Root lazyMount unmountOnExit>
              <Popover.Trigger className={button.Root}>More Options</Popover.Trigger>
              <Portal>
                <Popover.Positioner className={styles.Positioner}>
                  <Popover.Content className={styles.Content}>
                    <Popover.Arrow className={styles.Arrow}>
                      <Popover.ArrowTip className={styles.ArrowTip} />
                    </Popover.Arrow>
                    <Popover.CloseTrigger className={styles.CloseTrigger}>
                      <XIcon />
                    </Popover.CloseTrigger>
                    <Popover.Title className={styles.Title}>Additional Settings</Popover.Title>
                    <Popover.Description className={styles.Description}>
                      This popover renders correctly above the dialog.
                    </Popover.Description>
                  </Popover.Content>
                </Popover.Positioner>
              </Portal>
            </Popover.Root>

### Nested

Popovers can be nested within each other. Each nested popover maintains its own open state and positioning.

**Example: nested**

#### React

```tsx
import { Popover } from '@ark-ui/react/popover'
import { Portal } from '@ark-ui/react/portal'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/popover.module.css'

export const Nested = () => {
  return (
    <Popover.Root>
      <Popover.Trigger className={button.Root}>Click Me</Popover.Trigger>
      <Portal>
        <Popover.Positioner className={styles.Positioner}>
          <Popover.Content className={styles.Content}>
            <Popover.Title className={styles.Title}>Settings</Popover.Title>
            <Popover.Description className={styles.Description}>

## Guides

### Available Size

The following css variables are exposed to the `Popover.Positioner` which you can use to style the `Popover.Content`

```css
/* width of the popover trigger */
--reference-width: <pixel-value>;
/* width of the available viewport */
--available-width: <pixel-value>;
/* height of the available viewport */
--available-height: <pixel-value>;
```

For example, if you want to make sure the maximum height doesn't exceed the available height, use the following css:

```css
[data-scope='popover'][data-part='content'] {
  max-height: calc(var(--available-height) - 100px);
}
```

# QR Code



## Anatomy



```tsx
<QrCode.Root>
  <QrCode.Frame>
    <QrCode.Pattern />
  </QrCode.Frame>
  <QrCode.Overlay />
  <QrCode.DownloadTrigger />
</QrCode.Root>
```

## Examples

**Example: basic**

#### React

```tsx
import { QrCode } from '@ark-ui/react/qr-code'
import styles from 'styles/qr-code.module.css'

export const Basic = () => {
  return (
    <QrCode.Root className={styles.Root} defaultValue="http://ark-ui.com">
      <QrCode.Frame className={styles.Frame}>
        <QrCode.Pattern className={styles.Pattern} />
      </QrCode.Frame>
    </QrCode.Root>
  )
}

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { QrCode } from '@ark-ui/solid/qr-code'
import styles from 'styles/qr-code.module.css'

export const Basic = () => {
  return (
    <QrCode.Root class={styles.Root} defaultValue="http://ark-ui.com">
      <QrCode.Frame class={styles.Frame}>
        <QrCode.Pattern class={styles.Pattern} />
      </QrCode.Frame>
    </QrCode.Root>
  )
}

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { QrCode } from '@ark-ui/vue/qr-code'
import styles from 'styles/qr-code.module.css'
</script>

<template>
  <QrCode.Root :class="styles.Root" defaultValue="http://ark-ui.com">
    <QrCode.Frame :class="styles.Frame">
      <QrCode.Pattern :class="styles.Pattern" />
    </QrCode.Frame>
  </QrCode.Root>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { QrCode } from '@ark-ui/svelte/qr-code'
  import styles from 'styles/qr-code.module.css'
</script>

<QrCode.Root class={styles.Root} defaultValue="http://ark-ui.com">
  <QrCode.Frame class={styles.Frame}>
    <QrCode.Pattern class={styles.Pattern} />
  </QrCode.Frame>
</QrCode.Root>

```

### With Overlay

You can also add a logo or overlay to the QR code. This is useful when you want to brand the QR code.

**Example: overlay**

#### React

```tsx
import { QrCode } from '@ark-ui/react/qr-code'
import styles from 'styles/qr-code.module.css'

export const Overlay = () => {
  return (
    <QrCode.Root className={styles.Root} defaultValue="http://ark-ui.com" encoding={{ ecc: 'H' }}>
      <QrCode.Frame className={styles.Frame}>
        <QrCode.Pattern className={styles.Pattern} />
      </QrCode.Frame>
      <QrCode.Overlay className={styles.Overlay}>
        <img src="https://ark-ui.com/icon-192.png" alt="Ark UI Logo" />
      </QrCode.Overlay>
    </QrCode.Root>
  )
}

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { QrCode } from '@ark-ui/solid/qr-code'
import styles from 'styles/qr-code.module.css'

export const Overlay = () => {
  return (
    <QrCode.Root class={styles.Root} defaultValue="http://ark-ui.com" encoding={{ ecc: 'H' }}>
      <QrCode.Frame class={styles.Frame}>
        <QrCode.Pattern class={styles.Pattern} />
      </QrCode.Frame>
      <QrCode.Overlay class={styles.Overlay}>
        <img src="https://ark-ui.com/icon-192.png" alt="Ark UI Logo" />
      </QrCode.Overlay>
    </QrCode.Root>
  )
}

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { QrCode } from '@ark-ui/vue/qr-code'
import styles from 'styles/qr-code.module.css'
</script>

<template>
  <QrCode.Root :class="styles.Root" defaultValue="http://ark-ui.com" :encoding="{ ecc: 'H' }">
    <QrCode.Frame :class="styles.Frame">
      <QrCode.Pattern :class="styles.Pattern" />
    </QrCode.Frame>
    <QrCode.Overlay :class="styles.Overlay">
      <img src="https://ark-ui.com/icon-192.png" alt="Ark UI Logo" />
    </QrCode.Overlay>
  </QrCode.Root>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { QrCode } from '@ark-ui/svelte/qr-code'
  import styles from 'styles/qr-code.module.css'
</script>

<QrCode.Root class={styles.Root} defaultValue="http://ark-ui.com" encoding={{ ecc: 'H' }}>
  <QrCode.Frame class={styles.Frame}>
    <QrCode.Pattern class={styles.Pattern} />
  </QrCode.Frame>
  <QrCode.Overlay class={styles.Overlay}>
    <img src="https://ark-ui.com/icon-192.png" alt="Ark UI Logo" />
  </QrCode.Overlay>
</QrCode.Root>

```

### Error Correction

In cases where the link is too long or the logo overlay covers a significant area, the error correction level can be
increased.

Use the `encoding.ecc` or `encoding.boostEcc` property to set the error correction level:

- `L`: Allows recovery of up to 7% data loss (default)
- `M`: Allows recovery of up to 15% data loss
- `Q`: Allows recovery of up to 25% data loss
- `H`: Allows recovery of up to 30% data loss

**Example: error-correction**

#### React

```tsx
import { QrCode } from '@ark-ui/react/qr-code'
import { RadioGroup } from '@ark-ui/react/radio-group'
import { useState } from 'react'
import styles from 'styles/qr-code.module.css'
import radio from 'styles/radio-group.module.css'

type ErrorLevel = 'L' | 'M' | 'Q' | 'H'

export const ErrorCorrection = () => {
  const [errorLevel, setErrorLevel] = useState<ErrorLevel>('L')

  return (
    <div className="stack">
      <QrCode.Root className={styles.Root} defaultValue="http://ark-ui.com" encoding={{ ecc: errorLevel }}>
        <QrCode.Frame className={styles.Frame}>
          <QrCode.Pattern className={styles.Pattern} />
        </QrCode.Frame>
      </QrCode.Root>
      <RadioGroup.Root
        className={radio.Root}
        defaultValue="L"
        orientation="horizontal"
        onValueChange={(e) => setErrorLevel(e.value as ErrorLevel)}
      >
        <div className="hstack">
          {['L', 'M', 'Q', 'H'].map((level) => (
            <RadioGroup.Item className={radio.Item} key={level} value={level}>
              <RadioGroup.ItemControl className={radio.ItemControl} />
              <RadioGroup.ItemText className={radio.ItemText}>{level}</RadioGroup.ItemText>
              <RadioGroup.ItemHiddenInput />
            </RadioGroup.Item>
          ))}
        </div>
      </RadioGroup.Root>
    </div>
  )
}

```

import radio from 'styles/radio-group.module.css'

type ErrorLevel = 'L' | 'M' | 'Q' | 'H'
const errorLevel = ref<ErrorLevel>('L')
const levels: ErrorLevel[] = ['L', 'M', 'Q', 'H']
</script>

  import { RadioGroup } from '@ark-ui/svelte/radio-group'
  import styles from 'styles/qr-code.module.css'

      {/each}
    </div>
  </RadioGroup.Root>
</div>

```

### Root Provider

An alternative way to control the QR code is to use the `RootProvider` component and the `useQrCode` hook. This way you
can access the state and methods from outside the component.

**Example: root-provider**

#### React

```tsx
import { QrCode, useQrCode } from '@ark-ui/react/qr-code'
import styles from 'styles/qr-code.module.css'

export const RootProvider = () => {
  const qrCode = useQrCode({ value: 'http://ark-ui.com' })

  return (
    <div className="stack">
      <QrCode.RootProvider className={styles.Root} value={qrCode}>
        <QrCode.Frame className={styles.Frame}>
          <QrCode.Pattern className={styles.Pattern} />
        </QrCode.Frame>
      </QrCode.RootProvider>
      <output>{qrCode.value}</output>
    </div>
  )
}

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { QrCode, useQrCode } from '@ark-ui/solid/qr-code'
import styles from 'styles/qr-code.module.css'

export const RootProvider = () => {
  const qrCode = useQrCode({ value: 'http://ark-ui.com' })

  return (
    <div class="stack">
      <QrCode.RootProvider class={styles.Root} value={qrCode}>
        <QrCode.Frame class={styles.Frame}>
          <QrCode.Pattern class={styles.Pattern} />
        </QrCode.Frame>
      </QrCode.RootProvider>
      <output>{qrCode().value}</output>
    </div>
  )
}

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { QrCode, useQrCode } from '@ark-ui/vue/qr-code'
import styles from 'styles/qr-code.module.css'

const qrCode = useQrCode({ value: 'http://ark-ui.com' })
</script>

<template>
  <div class="stack">
    <QrCode.RootProvider :class="styles.Root" :value="qrCode">
      <QrCode.Frame :class="styles.Frame">
        <QrCode.Pattern :class="styles.Pattern" />
      </QrCode.Frame>
    </QrCode.RootProvider>
    <output>{{ qrCode.value }}</output>
  </div>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { QrCode, useQrCode } from '@ark-ui/svelte/qr-code'
  import styles from 'styles/qr-code.module.css'

  const id = $props.id()
  const qrCode = useQrCode({ id, value: 'http://ark-ui.com' })
</script>

<div class="stack">
  <QrCode.RootProvider class={styles.Root} value={qrCode}>
    <QrCode.Frame class={styles.Frame}>
      <QrCode.Pattern class={styles.Pattern} />
    </QrCode.Frame>
  </QrCode.RootProvider>
  <output>{qrCode().value}</output>
</div>

```

### Download

Use the `QrCode.DownloadTrigger` component to allow users to download the QR code as an image. Specify the `fileName`
and `mimeType` props for the downloaded file.

**Example: download**

#### React

```tsx
import { QrCode } from '@ark-ui/react/qr-code'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/qr-code.module.css'

export const Download = () => {
  return (
    <QrCode.Root className={styles.Root} defaultValue="http://ark-ui.com">
      <QrCode.Frame className={styles.Frame}>
        <QrCode.Pattern className={styles.Pattern} />
      </QrCode.Frame>
      <QrCode.DownloadTrigger className={button.Root} fileName="qr-code.png" mimeType="image/png">
        Download
      </QrCode.DownloadTrigger>
    </QrCode.Root>
  )
}

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { QrCode } from '@ark-ui/solid/qr-code'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/qr-code.module.css'

export const Download = () => {
  return (
    <QrCode.Root class={styles.Root} defaultValue="http://ark-ui.com">
      <QrCode.Frame class={styles.Frame}>
        <QrCode.Pattern class={styles.Pattern} />
      </QrCode.Frame>
      <QrCode.DownloadTrigger class={button.Root} fileName="qr-code.png" mimeType="image/png">
        Download
      </QrCode.DownloadTrigger>
    </QrCode.Root>
  )
}

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { QrCode } from '@ark-ui/vue/qr-code'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/qr-code.module.css'
</script>

<template>
  <QrCode.Root :class="styles.Root" defaultValue="http://ark-ui.com">
    <QrCode.Frame :class="styles.Frame">
      <QrCode.Pattern :class="styles.Pattern" />
    </QrCode.Frame>
    <QrCode.DownloadTrigger :class="button.Root" fileName="qr-code.png" mimeType="image/png">
      Download
    </QrCode.DownloadTrigger>
  </QrCode.Root>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { QrCode } from '@ark-ui/svelte/qr-code'
  import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
  import styles from 'styles/qr-code.module.css'
</script>

<QrCode.Root class={styles.Root} defaultValue="http://ark-ui.com">
  <QrCode.Frame class={styles.Frame}>
    <QrCode.Pattern class={styles.Pattern} />
  </QrCode.Frame>
  <QrCode.DownloadTrigger class={button.Root} fileName="qr-code.png" mimeType="image/png">
    Download
  </QrCode.DownloadTrigger>
</QrCode.Root>

```

# Radio Group



## Anatomy



```tsx
<RadioGroup.Root>
  <RadioGroup.Label />
  <RadioGroup.Indicator />
  <RadioGroup.Item>
    <RadioGroup.ItemControl />
    <RadioGroup.ItemText />
    <RadioGroup.ItemHiddenInput />
  </RadioGroup.Item>
</RadioGroup.Root>
```

## Examples

**Example: basic**

#### React

```tsx
import { RadioGroup } from '@ark-ui/react/radio-group'
import styles from 'styles/radio-group.module.css'

export const Basic = () => {
  const frameworks = ['React', 'Solid', 'Vue']

  return (
    <RadioGroup.Root className={styles.Root} defaultValue="React">
      <RadioGroup.Label className={styles.Label}>Framework</RadioGroup.Label>
      {frameworks.map((framework) => (
        <RadioGroup.Item className={styles.Item} key={framework} value={framework}>
          <RadioGroup.ItemControl className={styles.ItemControl} />
          <RadioGroup.ItemText className={styles.ItemText}>{framework}</RadioGroup.ItemText>
          <RadioGroup.ItemHiddenInput />
        </RadioGroup.Item>
      ))}
    </RadioGroup.Root>
  )
}

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { RadioGroup } from '@ark-ui/solid/radio-group'
import { For } from 'solid-js'
import styles from 'styles/radio-group.module.css'

export const Basic = () => {
  const frameworks = ['React', 'Solid', 'Vue']

  return (
    <RadioGroup.Root class={styles.Root} defaultValue="React">
      <RadioGroup.Label class={styles.Label}>Framework</RadioGroup.Label>
      <For each={frameworks}>
        {(framework) => (
          <RadioGroup.Item class={styles.Item} value={framework}>
            <RadioGroup.ItemControl class={styles.ItemControl} />
            <RadioGroup.ItemText class={styles.ItemText}>{framework}</RadioGroup.ItemText>
            <RadioGroup.ItemHiddenInput />
          </RadioGroup.Item>
        )}
      </For>
    </RadioGroup.Root>
  )
}

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { RadioGroup } from '@ark-ui/vue/radio-group'
import styles from 'styles/radio-group.module.css'

const frameworks = ['React', 'Solid', 'Vue']
</script>

<template>
  <RadioGroup.Root :class="styles.Root" default-value="React">
    <RadioGroup.Label :class="styles.Label">Framework</RadioGroup.Label>
    <RadioGroup.Item v-for="framework in frameworks" :key="framework" :class="styles.Item" :value="framework">
      <RadioGroup.ItemControl :class="styles.ItemControl" />
      <RadioGroup.ItemText :class="styles.ItemText">{{ framework }}</RadioGroup.ItemText>
      <RadioGroup.ItemHiddenInput />
    </RadioGroup.Item>
  </RadioGroup.Root>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { RadioGroup } from '@ark-ui/svelte/radio-group'
  import styles from 'styles/radio-group.module.css'

  const frameworks = ['React', 'Solid', 'Vue']
</script>

<RadioGroup.Root class={styles.Root} defaultValue="React">
  <RadioGroup.Label class={styles.Label}>Framework</RadioGroup.Label>
  {#each frameworks as framework}
    <RadioGroup.Item class={styles.Item} value={framework}>
      <RadioGroup.ItemControl class={styles.ItemControl} />
      <RadioGroup.ItemText class={styles.ItemText}>{framework}</RadioGroup.ItemText>
      <RadioGroup.ItemHiddenInput />
    </RadioGroup.Item>
  {/each}
</RadioGroup.Root>

```

### Initial Value

To set the radio group's initial value, set the `defaultValue` prop to the value of the radio item to be selected by
default.

**Example: initial-value**

#### React

```tsx
import { RadioGroup } from '@ark-ui/react/radio-group'
import styles from 'styles/radio-group.module.css'

export const InitialValue = () => {
  const frameworks = ['React', 'Solid', 'Vue']

  return (
    <RadioGroup.Root className={styles.Root} defaultValue="Solid">
      <RadioGroup.Label className={styles.Label}>Framework</RadioGroup.Label>
      {frameworks.map((framework) => (
        <RadioGroup.Item className={styles.Item} key={framework} value={framework}>
          <RadioGroup.ItemControl className={styles.ItemControl} />
          <RadioGroup.ItemText className={styles.ItemText}>{framework}</RadioGroup.ItemText>
          <RadioGroup.ItemHiddenInput />
        </RadioGroup.Item>
      ))}
    </RadioGroup.Root>
  )
}

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { RadioGroup } from '@ark-ui/solid/radio-group'
import { For } from 'solid-js'
import styles from 'styles/radio-group.module.css'

export const InitialValue = () => {
  const frameworks = ['React', 'Solid', 'Vue']

  return (
    <RadioGroup.Root class={styles.Root} defaultValue="Solid">
      <RadioGroup.Label class={styles.Label}>Framework</RadioGroup.Label>
      <For each={frameworks}>
        {(framework) => (
          <RadioGroup.Item class={styles.Item} value={framework}>
            <RadioGroup.ItemControl class={styles.ItemControl} />
            <RadioGroup.ItemText class={styles.ItemText}>{framework}</RadioGroup.ItemText>
            <RadioGroup.ItemHiddenInput />
          </RadioGroup.Item>
        )}
      </For>
    </RadioGroup.Root>
  )
}

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { RadioGroup } from '@ark-ui/vue/radio-group'
import styles from 'styles/radio-group.module.css'

const frameworks = ['React', 'Solid', 'Vue']
</script>

<template>
  <RadioGroup.Root :class="styles.Root" defaultValue="Solid">
    <RadioGroup.Label :class="styles.Label">Framework</RadioGroup.Label>
    <RadioGroup.Item v-for="framework in frameworks" :key="framework" :class="styles.Item" :value="framework">
      <RadioGroup.ItemControl :class="styles.ItemControl" />
      <RadioGroup.ItemText :class="styles.ItemText">{{ framework }}</RadioGroup.ItemText>
      <RadioGroup.ItemHiddenInput />
    </RadioGroup.Item>
  </RadioGroup.Root>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { RadioGroup } from '@ark-ui/svelte/radio-group'
  import styles from 'styles/radio-group.module.css'

  const frameworks = ['React', 'Solid', 'Vue']
</script>

<RadioGroup.Root class={styles.Root} defaultValue="Solid">
  <RadioGroup.Label class={styles.Label}>Framework</RadioGroup.Label>
  {#each frameworks as framework}
    <RadioGroup.Item class={styles.Item} value={framework}>
      <RadioGroup.ItemControl class={styles.ItemControl} />
      <RadioGroup.ItemText class={styles.ItemText}>{framework}</RadioGroup.ItemText>
      <RadioGroup.ItemHiddenInput />
    </RadioGroup.Item>
  {/each}
</RadioGroup.Root>

```

### Controlled

For a controlled Radio Group, the state is managed using the `value` prop, and updates when the `onValueChange` event
handler is called:

**Example: controlled**

#### React

```tsx
import { RadioGroup } from '@ark-ui/react/radio-group'
import { useState } from 'react'
import styles from 'styles/radio-group.module.css'

export const Controlled = () => {
  const frameworks = ['React', 'Solid', 'Vue']
  const [value, setValue] = useState<string | null>(null)

  return (
    <RadioGroup.Root className={styles.Root} value={value} onValueChange={(e) => setValue(e.value)}>
      <RadioGroup.Label className={styles.Label}>Framework</RadioGroup.Label>
      {frameworks.map((framework) => (
        <RadioGroup.Item className={styles.Item} key={framework} value={framework}>
          <RadioGroup.ItemControl className={styles.ItemControl} />
          <RadioGroup.ItemText className={styles.ItemText}>{framework}</RadioGroup.ItemText>
          <RadioGroup.ItemHiddenInput />
        </RadioGroup.Item>
      ))}
    </RadioGroup.Root>
  )
}

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { RadioGroup } from '@ark-ui/solid/radio-group'
import { For, createSignal } from 'solid-js'
import styles from 'styles/radio-group.module.css'

export const Controlled = () => {
  const frameworks = ['React', 'Solid', 'Vue']
  const [value, setValue] = createSignal<string | null>(null)

  return (
    <RadioGroup.Root class={styles.Root} value={value()} onValueChange={(e) => setValue(e.value)}>
      <RadioGroup.Label class={styles.Label}>Framework</RadioGroup.Label>
      <For each={frameworks}>
        {(framework) => (
          <RadioGroup.Item class={styles.Item} value={framework}>
            <RadioGroup.ItemControl class={styles.ItemControl} />
            <RadioGroup.ItemText class={styles.ItemText}>{framework}</RadioGroup.ItemText>
            <RadioGroup.ItemHiddenInput />
          </RadioGroup.Item>
        )}
      </For>
    </RadioGroup.Root>
  )
}

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { RadioGroup } from '@ark-ui/vue/radio-group'
import { ref } from 'vue'
import styles from 'styles/radio-group.module.css'

const frameworks = ['React', 'Solid', 'Vue']
const value = ref<string | null>(null)
</script>

<template>
  <RadioGroup.Root :class="styles.Root" v-model="value">
    <RadioGroup.Label :class="styles.Label">Framework</RadioGroup.Label>
    <RadioGroup.Item v-for="framework in frameworks" :key="framework" :class="styles.Item" :value="framework">
      <RadioGroup.ItemControl :class="styles.ItemControl" />
      <RadioGroup.ItemText :class="styles.ItemText">{{ framework }}</RadioGroup.ItemText>
      <RadioGroup.ItemHiddenInput />
    </RadioGroup.Item>
  </RadioGroup.Root>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { RadioGroup } from '@ark-ui/svelte/radio-group'
  import styles from 'styles/radio-group.module.css'

  const frameworks = ['React', 'Solid', 'Vue']
  let value = $state<string | null>(null)
</script>

<RadioGroup.Root class={styles.Root} bind:value>
  <RadioGroup.Label class={styles.Label}>Framework</RadioGroup.Label>
  {#each frameworks as framework}
    <RadioGroup.Item class={styles.Item} value={framework}>
      <RadioGroup.ItemControl class={styles.ItemControl} />
      <RadioGroup.ItemText class={styles.ItemText}>{framework}</RadioGroup.ItemText>
      <RadioGroup.ItemHiddenInput />
    </RadioGroup.Item>
  {/each}
</RadioGroup.Root>

```

### Root Provider

An alternative way to control the radio group is to use the `RootProvider` component and the `useRadioGroup` hook. This
way you can access the state and methods from outside the component.

**Example: root-provider**

#### React

```tsx
import { RadioGroup, useRadioGroup } from '@ark-ui/react/radio-group'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/radio-group.module.css'

export const RootProvider = () => {
  const frameworks = ['React', 'Solid', 'Vue']
  const radioGroup = useRadioGroup({ defaultValue: 'React' })

  return (
    <div className="stack">
      <RadioGroup.RootProvider className={styles.Root} value={radioGroup}>
        <RadioGroup.Label className={styles.Label}>Framework</RadioGroup.Label>
        {frameworks.map((framework) => (
          <RadioGroup.Item className={styles.Item} key={framework} value={framework}>
            <RadioGroup.ItemControl className={styles.ItemControl} />
            <RadioGroup.ItemText className={styles.ItemText}>{framework}</RadioGroup.ItemText>
            <RadioGroup.ItemHiddenInput />
          </RadioGroup.Item>
        ))}
      </RadioGroup.RootProvider>

      <button className={button.Root} onClick={() => radioGroup.setValue('Solid')}>
        Set to Solid
      </button>
    </div>
  )
}

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { RadioGroup, useRadioGroup } from '@ark-ui/solid/radio-group'
import { For } from 'solid-js'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/radio-group.module.css'

export const RootProvider = () => {
  const frameworks = ['React', 'Solid', 'Vue']
  const radioGroup = useRadioGroup({ defaultValue: 'React' })

  return (
    <div class="stack">
      <RadioGroup.RootProvider class={styles.Root} value={radioGroup}>
        <RadioGroup.Label class={styles.Label}>Framework</RadioGroup.Label>
        <For each={frameworks}>
          {(framework) => (
            <RadioGroup.Item class={styles.Item} value={framework}>
              <RadioGroup.ItemControl class={styles.ItemControl} />
              <RadioGroup.ItemText class={styles.ItemText}>{framework}</RadioGroup.ItemText>
              <RadioGroup.ItemHiddenInput />
            </RadioGroup.Item>
          )}
        </For>
      </RadioGroup.RootProvider>

      <button class={button.Root} onClick={() => radioGroup().setValue('Solid')}>
        Set to Solid
      </button>
    </div>
  )
}

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { RadioGroup, useRadioGroup } from '@ark-ui/vue/radio-group'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/radio-group.module.css'

const frameworks = ['React', 'Solid', 'Vue']
const radioGroup = useRadioGroup({ defaultValue: 'React' })
</script>

<template>
  <div class="stack">
    <RadioGroup.RootProvider :class="styles.Root" :value="radioGroup">
      <RadioGroup.Label :class="styles.Label">Framework</RadioGroup.Label>
      <RadioGroup.Item v-for="framework in frameworks" :key="framework" :class="styles.Item" :value="framework">
        <RadioGroup.ItemControl :class="styles.ItemControl" />
        <RadioGroup.ItemText :class="styles.ItemText">{{ framework }}</RadioGroup.ItemText>
        <RadioGroup.ItemHiddenInput />
      </RadioGroup.Item>
    </RadioGroup.RootProvider>

    <button :class="button.Root" @click="radioGroup.setValue('Solid')">Set to Solid</button>
  </div>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { RadioGroup, useRadioGroup } from '@ark-ui/svelte/radio-group'
  import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
  import styles from 'styles/radio-group.module.css'

  const frameworks = ['React', 'Solid', 'Vue']

  const id = $props.id()
  const radioGroup = useRadioGroup({ id, defaultValue: 'React' })
</script>

<div class="stack">
  <RadioGroup.RootProvider class={styles.Root} value={radioGroup}>
    <RadioGroup.Label class={styles.Label}>Framework</RadioGroup.Label>
    {#each frameworks as framework}
      <RadioGroup.Item class={styles.Item} value={framework}>
        <RadioGroup.ItemControl class={styles.ItemControl} />
        <RadioGroup.ItemText class={styles.ItemText}>{framework}</RadioGroup.ItemText>
        <RadioGroup.ItemHiddenInput />
      </RadioGroup.Item>
    {/each}
  </RadioGroup.RootProvider>

  <button class={button.Root} onclick={() => radioGroup().setValue('Solid')}>Set to Solid</button>
</div>

```

### Disabled

To make a radio group disabled, set the `disabled` prop to `true`.

**Example: disabled**

#### React

```tsx
import { RadioGroup } from '@ark-ui/react/radio-group'
import styles from 'styles/radio-group.module.css'

export const Disabled = () => {
  const frameworks = ['React', 'Solid', 'Vue']

  return (
    <RadioGroup.Root className={styles.Root} defaultValue="React" disabled>
      <RadioGroup.Label className={styles.Label}>Framework</RadioGroup.Label>
      {frameworks.map((framework) => (
        <RadioGroup.Item className={styles.Item} key={framework} value={framework}>
          <RadioGroup.ItemControl className={styles.ItemControl} />
          <RadioGroup.ItemText className={styles.ItemText}>{framework}</RadioGroup.ItemText>
          <RadioGroup.ItemHiddenInput />
        </RadioGroup.Item>
      ))}
    </RadioGroup.Root>
  )
}

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { RadioGroup } from '@ark-ui/solid/radio-group'
import { For } from 'solid-js'
import styles from 'styles/radio-group.module.css'

export const Disabled = () => {
  const frameworks = ['React', 'Solid', 'Vue']

  return (
    <RadioGroup.Root class={styles.Root} defaultValue="React" disabled>
      <RadioGroup.Label class={styles.Label}>Framework</RadioGroup.Label>
      <For each={frameworks}>
        {(framework) => (
          <RadioGroup.Item class={styles.Item} value={framework}>
            <RadioGroup.ItemControl class={styles.ItemControl} />
            <RadioGroup.ItemText class={styles.ItemText}>{framework}</RadioGroup.ItemText>
            <RadioGroup.ItemHiddenInput />
          </RadioGroup.Item>
        )}
      </For>
    </RadioGroup.Root>
  )
}

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { RadioGroup } from '@ark-ui/vue/radio-group'
import styles from 'styles/radio-group.module.css'

const frameworks = ['React', 'Solid', 'Vue']

## Guides

### asChild

The `RadioGroup.Item` component renders as a `label` element by default. This ensures proper form semantics and
accessibility, as radio groups are form controls that require labels to provide meaningful context for users.

When using the `asChild` prop, you must **render a `label` element** as the direct child of `RadioGroup.Item` to
maintain valid HTML structure and accessibility compliance.

```tsx
// INCORRECT usage ❌
<RadioGroup.Item asChild>
  <div>
    <RadioGroup.ItemHiddenInput />
    <RadioGroup.ItemText>
      <RadioGroup.ItemControl />
    </RadioGroup.ItemText>
  </div>
</RadioGroup.Item>

// CORRECT usage ✅
<RadioGroup.Item asChild>
  <label>
    <RadioGroup.ItemHiddenInput />
    <RadioGroup.ItemText>
      <RadioGroup.ItemControl />
    </RadioGroup.ItemText>
  </label>
</RadioGroup.Item>
```

### Hidden Input

The `RadioGroup.ItemHiddenInput` component renders a hidden HTML input element that enables proper form submission and
integration with native form behaviors. This component is essential for the radio group to function correctly as it:

- Provides the underlying input element that browsers use for form submission
- Enables integration with form libraries and validation systems
- Ensures the radio group works with native form reset functionality

```tsx
// INCORRECT usage ❌
<RadioGroup.Item>
  <RadioGroup.ItemText>
    <RadioGroup.ItemControl />
  </RadioGroup.ItemText>
</RadioGroup.Item>

// CORRECT usage ✅
<RadioGroup.Item>
  <RadioGroup.ItemHiddenInput />
  <RadioGroup.ItemText>
    <RadioGroup.ItemControl />
  </RadioGroup.ItemText>
</RadioGroup.Item>
```

  </RatingGroup.Root>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { RatingGroup } from '@ark-ui/svelte/rating-group'
  import { StarIcon } from 'lucide-svelte'
  import styles from 'styles/rating-group.module.css'
</script>

<RatingGroup.Root class={styles.Root} defaultValue={3}>
  <RatingGroup.Label class={styles.Label}>Label</RatingGroup.Label>
  <RatingGroup.Control class={styles.Control}>
    <RatingGroup.Context>
      {#snippet render(ratingGroup)}
        {#each ratingGroup().items as item}
          <RatingGroup.Item class={styles.Item} index={item}>
            <RatingGroup.ItemContext>
              {#snippet render(itemState)}
                <span class={styles.ItemIndicator} data-highlighted={itemState().highlighted ? '' : undefined}>
                  <StarIcon data-bg="" />
                  <StarIcon data-fg="" fill="currentColor" />
                </span>
              {/snippet}
            </RatingGroup.ItemContext>
          </RatingGroup.Item>
        {/each}
      {/snippet}
    </RatingGroup.Context>
    <RatingGroup.HiddenInput />
  </RatingGroup.Control>
</RatingGroup.Root>

```

### Controlled

When using the `RatingGroup` component, you can use the `value` and `onValueChange` props to control the state.

**Example: controlled**

#### React

```tsx
import { RatingGroup } from '@ark-ui/react/rating-group'
import { StarIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import { useState } from 'react'
import styles from 'styles/rating-group.module.css'

export const Controlled = () => {
  const [value, setValue] = useState(0)

  return (
    <RatingGroup.Root className={styles.Root} value={value} onValueChange={(details) => setValue(details.value)}>
      <RatingGroup.Label className={styles.Label}>Label</RatingGroup.Label>
      <RatingGroup.Control className={styles.Control}>
        <RatingGroup.Context>
          {({ items }) =>
            items.map((item) => (
              <RatingGroup.Item className={styles.Item} key={item} index={item}>
                <RatingGroup.ItemContext>
                  {({ half, highlighted }) => (
                    <span
                      className={styles.ItemIndicator}
                      data-half={half ? '' : undefined}
                      data-highlighted={highlighted ? '' : undefined}
                    >
                      <StarIcon data-bg="" />
                      <StarIcon data-fg="" fill="currentColor" />
                    </span>
                  )}
                </RatingGroup.ItemContext>
              </RatingGroup.Item>
            ))
          }
        </RatingGroup.Context>
        <RatingGroup.HiddenInput />
      </RatingGroup.Control>
    </RatingGroup.Root>
  )
}

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { RatingGroup } from '@ark-ui/solid/rating-group'
import { StarIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { Index, createSignal } from 'solid-js'
import styles from 'styles/rating-group.module.css'

export const Controlled = () => {
  const [value, setValue] = createSignal(0)

  return (
    <RatingGroup.Root class={styles.Root} value={value()} onValueChange={(details) => setValue(details.value)}>
      <RatingGroup.Label class={styles.Label}>Label</RatingGroup.Label>
      <RatingGroup.Control class={styles.Control}>
        <RatingGroup.Context>
          {(context) => (
            <Index each={context().items}>
              {(item) => (
                <RatingGroup.Item class={styles.Item} index={item()}>
                  <RatingGroup.ItemContext>
                    {(itemContext) => (
                      <span
                        class={styles.ItemIndicator}
                        data-half={itemContext().half ? '' : undefined}
                        data-highlighted={itemContext().highlighted ? '' : undefined}
                      >
                        <StarIcon data-bg="" />
                        <StarIcon data-fg="" fill="currentColor" />
                      </span>
                    )}
                  </RatingGroup.ItemContext>
                </RatingGroup.Item>
              )}
            </Index>
          )}
        </RatingGroup.Context>
        <RatingGroup.HiddenInput />
      </RatingGroup.Control>
    </RatingGroup.Root>
  )
}

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { RatingGroup } from '@ark-ui/vue/rating-group'
import { StarIcon } from 'lucide-vue-next'
import { ref } from 'vue'
import styles from 'styles/rating-group.module.css'

const value = ref(0)
</script>

<template>
  <RatingGroup.Root :class="styles.Root" v-model="value">
    <RatingGroup.Label :class="styles.Label">Label</RatingGroup.Label>
    <RatingGroup.Control :class="styles.Control">
      <RatingGroup.Context v-slot="{ items }">
        <RatingGroup.Item v-for="item in items" :key="item" :class="styles.Item" :index="item">
          <RatingGroup.ItemContext v-slot="{ half, highlighted }">
            <span
              :class="styles.ItemIndicator"
              :data-half="half ? '' : undefined"
              :data-highlighted="highlighted ? '' : undefined"
            >
              <StarIcon data-bg="" />
              <StarIcon data-fg="" fill="currentColor" />
            </span>
          </RatingGroup.ItemContext>
        </RatingGroup.Item>
      </RatingGroup.Context>
      <RatingGroup.HiddenInput />
    </RatingGroup.Control>
  </RatingGroup.Root>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { RatingGroup } from '@ark-ui/svelte/rating-group'
  import { StarIcon } from 'lucide-svelte'
  import styles from 'styles/rating-group.module.css'

  let value = $state(0)
</script>

<RatingGroup.Root class={styles.Root} bind:value>
  <RatingGroup.Label class={styles.Label}>Label</RatingGroup.Label>
  <RatingGroup.Control class={styles.Control}>
    <RatingGroup.Context>
      {#snippet render(ratingGroup)}
        {#each ratingGroup().items as item}
          <RatingGroup.Item class={styles.Item} index={item}>
            <RatingGroup.ItemContext>
              {#snippet render(itemState)}
                <span
                  class={styles.ItemIndicator}
                  data-half={itemState().half ? '' : undefined}
                  data-highlighted={itemState().highlighted ? '' : undefined}
                >
                  <StarIcon data-bg="" />
                  <StarIcon data-fg="" fill="currentColor" />
                </span>
              {/snippet}
            </RatingGroup.ItemContext>
          </RatingGroup.Item>
        {/each}
      {/snippet}
    </RatingGroup.Context>
    <RatingGroup.HiddenInput />
  </RatingGroup.Control>
</RatingGroup.Root>

```

### Root Provider

An alternative way to control the rating group is to use the `RootProvider` component and the `useRatingGroup` hook.
This way you can access the state and methods from outside the component.

**Example: root-provider**

#### React

```tsx
import { RatingGroup, useRatingGroup } from '@ark-ui/react/rating-group'
import { StarIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import styles from 'styles/rating-group.module.css'

export const RootProvider = () => {
  const ratingGroup = useRatingGroup({ count: 5, defaultValue: 3 })

  return (
    <div className="stack">
      <output>value: {ratingGroup.value}</output>
      <RatingGroup.RootProvider className={styles.Root} value={ratingGroup}>
        <RatingGroup.Label className={styles.Label}>Label</RatingGroup.Label>
        <RatingGroup.Control className={styles.Control}>
          <RatingGroup.Context>
            {({ items }) =>
              items.map((item) => (
                <RatingGroup.Item className={styles.Item} key={item} index={item}>
                  <RatingGroup.ItemContext>
                    {({ highlighted }) => (
                      <span className={styles.ItemIndicator} data-highlighted={highlighted ? '' : undefined}>
                        <StarIcon data-bg="" />
                        <StarIcon data-fg="" fill="currentColor" />
                      </span>
                    )}
                  </RatingGroup.ItemContext>
                </RatingGroup.Item>
              ))
            }
          </RatingGroup.Context>
          <RatingGroup.HiddenInput />
        </RatingGroup.Control>
      </RatingGroup.RootProvider>
    </div>
  )
}

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { RatingGroup, useRatingGroup } from '@ark-ui/solid/rating-group'
import { StarIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { Index } from 'solid-js'
import styles from 'styles/rating-group.module.css'

export const RootProvider = () => {
  const ratingGroup = useRatingGroup({ defaultValue: 3 })

  return (
    <div class="stack">
      <output>value: {ratingGroup().value}</output>
      <RatingGroup.RootProvider class={styles.Root} value={ratingGroup}>
        <RatingGroup.Label class={styles.Label}>Label</RatingGroup.Label>
        <RatingGroup.Control class={styles.Control}>
          <RatingGroup.Context>
            {(context) => (
              <Index each={context().items}>
                {(item) => (
                  <RatingGroup.Item class={styles.Item} index={item()}>
                    <RatingGroup.ItemContext>
                      {(itemContext) => (
                        <span
                          class={styles.ItemIndicator}
                          data-highlighted={itemContext().highlighted ? '' : undefined}
                        >
                          <StarIcon data-bg="" />
                          <StarIcon data-fg="" fill="currentColor" />
                        </span>
                      )}
                    </RatingGroup.ItemContext>
                  </RatingGroup.Item>
                )}
              </Index>
            )}
          </RatingGroup.Context>
          <RatingGroup.HiddenInput />
        </RatingGroup.Control>
      </RatingGroup.RootProvider>
    </div>
  )
}

```

    <output>value: {{ ratingGroup.value }}</output>
    <RatingGroup.RootProvider :class="styles.Root" :value="ratingGroup">

        </RatingGroup.Context>
        <RatingGroup.HiddenInput />
      </RatingGroup.Control>
    </RatingGroup.RootProvider>
  </div>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { RatingGroup, useRatingGroup } from '@ark-ui/svelte/rating-group'
  import { StarIcon } from 'lucide-svelte'
  import styles from 'styles/rating-group.module.css'

  const id = $props.id()
  const ratingGroup = useRatingGroup({ id, defaultValue: 3 })
</script>

<div class="stack">

      </RatingGroup.Context>
      <RatingGroup.HiddenInput />
    </RatingGroup.Control>
  </RatingGroup.RootProvider>
</div>

```

### Field

The `Field` component helps manage form-related state and accessibility attributes of a rating group. It includes
handling ARIA labels, helper text, and error text to ensure proper accessibility.

**Example: with-field**

#### React

```tsx
import { Field } from '@ark-ui/react/field'
import { RatingGroup } from '@ark-ui/react/rating-group'
import { StarIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import field from 'styles/field.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/rating-group.module.css'

export const WithField = () => (
  <Field.Root className={field.Root}>
    <RatingGroup.Root className={styles.Root} count={5} defaultValue={3}>
      <RatingGroup.Label className={styles.Label}>Label</RatingGroup.Label>
      <RatingGroup.Control className={styles.Control}>
        <RatingGroup.Context>
          {({ items }) =>
            items.map((item) => (
              <RatingGroup.Item className={styles.Item} key={item} index={item}>
                <RatingGroup.ItemContext>
                  {({ highlighted }) => (
                    <span className={styles.ItemIndicator} data-highlighted={highlighted ? '' : undefined}>
                      <StarIcon data-bg="" />
                      <StarIcon data-fg="" fill="currentColor" />
                    </span>
                  )}
                </RatingGroup.ItemContext>
              </RatingGroup.Item>
            ))
          }
        </RatingGroup.Context>
        <RatingGroup.HiddenInput />
      </RatingGroup.Control>
    </RatingGroup.Root>
    <Field.HelperText className={field.HelperText}>Additional Info</Field.HelperText>
    <Field.ErrorText className={field.ErrorText}>Error Info</Field.ErrorText>
  </Field.Root>
)

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Field } from '@ark-ui/solid/field'
import { RatingGroup } from '@ark-ui/solid/rating-group'
import { StarIcon } from 'lucide-solid'

      <RatingGroup.Control class={styles.Control}>
        <RatingGroup.Context>
          {(context) => (
            <Index each={context().items}>
              {(item) => (
                <RatingGroup.Item class={styles.Item} index={item()}>
                  <RatingGroup.ItemContext>
                    {(itemContext) => (
                      <span class={styles.ItemIndicator} data-highlighted={itemContext().highlighted ? '' : undefined}>
                        <StarIcon data-bg="" />

                      </span>
                    )}
                  </RatingGroup.ItemContext>
                </RatingGroup.Item>
              )}
            </Index>
          )}
        </RatingGroup.Context>
        <RatingGroup.HiddenInput />
      </RatingGroup.Control>
    </RatingGroup.Root>
    <Field.HelperText class={field.HelperText}>Additional Info</Field.HelperText>
    <Field.ErrorText class={field.ErrorText}>Error Info</Field.ErrorText>
  </Field.Root>

# Scroll Area



## Anatomy



```tsx
<ScrollArea.Root>
  <ScrollArea.Viewport>
    <ScrollArea.Content />
  </ScrollArea.Viewport>
  <ScrollArea.Scrollbar>
    <ScrollArea.Thumb />
  </ScrollArea.Scrollbar>
  <ScrollArea.Corner />
</ScrollArea.Root>
```

## Required style

It's important to note that the scroll area requires the following styles on the `ScrollArea.Viewport` element to hide
the native scrollbar:

```css
[data-scope='scroll-area'][data-part='viewport'] {
  scrollbar-width: none;
  &::-webkit-scrollbar {
    display: none;
  }
}
```

## Examples

### Basic

Create a basic scrollable area with custom scrollbar.

**Example: basic**

#### React

```tsx
import { ScrollArea } from '@ark-ui/react/scroll-area'
import styles from 'styles/scroll-area.module.css'

export const Basic = () => (
  <ScrollArea.Root className={styles.Root}>
    <ScrollArea.Viewport className={styles.Viewport}>
      <ScrollArea.Content className={styles.Content}>
        <p className={styles.Paragraph}>

### Nested

Scroll areas can be nested within each other for complex layouts.

**Example: nested**

#### React

```tsx

# Segment Group



## Anatomy



```tsx
<SegmentGroup.Root>
  <SegmentGroup.Indicator />
  <SegmentGroup.Item>
    <SegmentGroup.ItemText />
    <SegmentGroup.ItemControl />
    <SegmentGroup.ItemHiddenInput />
  </SegmentGroup.Item>
</SegmentGroup.Root>
```

## Examples

**Example: basic**

#### React

```tsx
import { SegmentGroup } from '@ark-ui/react/segment-group'
import styles from 'styles/segment-group.module.css'

export const Basic = () => {
  const frameworks = ['React', 'Solid', 'Svelte', 'Vue']
  return (
    <SegmentGroup.Root className={styles.Root} defaultValue="React">
      <SegmentGroup.Indicator className={styles.Indicator} />
      {frameworks.map((framework) => (
        <SegmentGroup.Item className={styles.Item} key={framework} value={framework}>
          <SegmentGroup.ItemText className={styles.ItemText}>{framework}</SegmentGroup.ItemText>
          <SegmentGroup.ItemControl className={styles.ItemControl} />
          <SegmentGroup.ItemHiddenInput />
        </SegmentGroup.Item>
      ))}
    </SegmentGroup.Root>
  )
}

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { SegmentGroup } from '@ark-ui/solid/segment-group'
import { Index } from 'solid-js'
import styles from 'styles/segment-group.module.css'

export const Basic = () => {
  const frameworks = ['React', 'Solid', 'Svelte', 'Vue']
  return (
    <SegmentGroup.Root class={styles.Root} defaultValue="React">
      <SegmentGroup.Indicator class={styles.Indicator} />
      <Index each={frameworks}>
        {(framework) => (
          <SegmentGroup.Item class={styles.Item} value={framework()}>
            <SegmentGroup.ItemText class={styles.ItemText}>{framework()}</SegmentGroup.ItemText>
            <SegmentGroup.ItemControl class={styles.ItemControl} />
            <SegmentGroup.ItemHiddenInput />
          </SegmentGroup.Item>
        )}
      </Index>
    </SegmentGroup.Root>
  )
}

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { SegmentGroup } from '@ark-ui/vue/segment-group'
import styles from 'styles/segment-group.module.css'

const frameworks = ['React', 'Solid', 'Svelte', 'Vue']
</script>

<template>
  <SegmentGroup.Root :class="styles.Root" default-value="React">
    <SegmentGroup.Indicator :class="styles.Indicator" />
    <SegmentGroup.Item v-for="framework in frameworks" :key="framework" :class="styles.Item" :value="framework">
      <SegmentGroup.ItemText :class="styles.ItemText">{{ framework }}</SegmentGroup.ItemText>
      <SegmentGroup.ItemControl :class="styles.ItemControl" />
      <SegmentGroup.ItemHiddenInput />
    </SegmentGroup.Item>
  </SegmentGroup.Root>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { SegmentGroup } from '@ark-ui/svelte/segment-group'
  import styles from 'styles/segment-group.module.css'

  const frameworks = ['React', 'Solid', 'Svelte', 'Vue']
</script>

<SegmentGroup.Root class={styles.Root} defaultValue="React">
  <SegmentGroup.Indicator class={styles.Indicator} />
  {#each frameworks as framework}
    <SegmentGroup.Item class={styles.Item} value={framework}>
      <SegmentGroup.ItemText class={styles.ItemText}>{framework}</SegmentGroup.ItemText>
      <SegmentGroup.ItemControl class={styles.ItemControl} />
      <SegmentGroup.ItemHiddenInput />
    </SegmentGroup.Item>
  {/each}
</SegmentGroup.Root>

```

### Controlled

To create a controlled SegmentGroup component, manage the current selected segment using the `value` prop and update it
when the `onValueChange` event handler is called:

**Example: controlled**

#### React

```tsx
import { SegmentGroup } from '@ark-ui/react/segment-group'
import { useState } from 'react'
import styles from 'styles/segment-group.module.css'

export const Controlled = () => {
  const frameworks = ['React', 'Solid', 'Svelte', 'Vue']
  const [value, setValue] = useState<string | null>(null)
  return (
    <SegmentGroup.Root className={styles.Root} value={value} onValueChange={(e) => setValue(e.value)}>
      <SegmentGroup.Indicator className={styles.Indicator} />
      {frameworks.map((framework) => (
        <SegmentGroup.Item className={styles.Item} key={framework} value={framework}>
          <SegmentGroup.ItemText className={styles.ItemText}>{framework}</SegmentGroup.ItemText>
          <SegmentGroup.ItemControl className={styles.ItemControl} />
          <SegmentGroup.ItemHiddenInput />
        </SegmentGroup.Item>
      ))}
    </SegmentGroup.Root>
  )
}

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { SegmentGroup } from '@ark-ui/solid/segment-group'
import { Index, createSignal } from 'solid-js'
import styles from 'styles/segment-group.module.css'

export const Controlled = () => {
  const frameworks = ['React', 'Solid', 'Svelte', 'Vue']
  const [value, setValue] = createSignal<string | null>(null)

  return (
    <SegmentGroup.Root class={styles.Root} value={value()} onValueChange={(e) => setValue(e.value)}>
      <SegmentGroup.Indicator class={styles.Indicator} />
      <Index each={frameworks}>
        {(framework) => (
          <SegmentGroup.Item class={styles.Item} value={framework()}>
            <SegmentGroup.ItemText class={styles.ItemText}>{framework()}</SegmentGroup.ItemText>
            <SegmentGroup.ItemControl class={styles.ItemControl} />
            <SegmentGroup.ItemHiddenInput />
          </SegmentGroup.Item>
        )}
      </Index>
    </SegmentGroup.Root>
  )
}

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { SegmentGroup } from '@ark-ui/vue/segment-group'
import { ref } from 'vue'
import styles from 'styles/segment-group.module.css'

const frameworks = ['React', 'Solid', 'Svelte', 'Vue']
const value = ref<string | null>(null)
</script>

<template>
  <SegmentGroup.Root :class="styles.Root" v-model="value">
    <SegmentGroup.Indicator :class="styles.Indicator" />
    <SegmentGroup.Item v-for="framework in frameworks" :key="framework" :class="styles.Item" :value="framework">
      <SegmentGroup.ItemText :class="styles.ItemText">{{ framework }}</SegmentGroup.ItemText>
      <SegmentGroup.ItemControl :class="styles.ItemControl" />
      <SegmentGroup.ItemHiddenInput />
    </SegmentGroup.Item>
  </SegmentGroup.Root>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { SegmentGroup } from '@ark-ui/svelte/segment-group'
  import styles from 'styles/segment-group.module.css'

  let value = $state<string | null>(null)

  const frameworks = ['React', 'Solid', 'Svelte', 'Vue']
</script>

<SegmentGroup.Root class={styles.Root} bind:value>
  <SegmentGroup.Indicator class={styles.Indicator} />
  {#each frameworks as framework}
    <SegmentGroup.Item class={styles.Item} value={framework}>
      <SegmentGroup.ItemText class={styles.ItemText}>{framework}</SegmentGroup.ItemText>
      <SegmentGroup.ItemControl class={styles.ItemControl} />
      <SegmentGroup.ItemHiddenInput />
    </SegmentGroup.Item>
  {/each}
</SegmentGroup.Root>

```

### Root Provider

An alternative way to control the segment group is to use the `RootProvider` component and the `useSegmentGroup` hook.
This way you can access the state and methods from outside the component.

**Example: root-provider**

#### React

```tsx
import { SegmentGroup, useSegmentGroup } from '@ark-ui/react/segment-group'
import styles from 'styles/segment-group.module.css'

export const RootProvider = () => {
  const frameworks = ['React', 'Solid', 'Svelte', 'Vue']
  const segmentGroup = useSegmentGroup({ defaultValue: 'React' })

  return (
    <div className="stack">
      <SegmentGroup.RootProvider className={styles.Root} value={segmentGroup}>
        <SegmentGroup.Indicator className={styles.Indicator} />
        {frameworks.map((framework) => (
          <SegmentGroup.Item className={styles.Item} key={framework} value={framework}>
            <SegmentGroup.ItemText className={styles.ItemText}>{framework}</SegmentGroup.ItemText>
            <SegmentGroup.ItemControl className={styles.ItemControl} />
            <SegmentGroup.ItemHiddenInput />
          </SegmentGroup.Item>
        ))}
      </SegmentGroup.RootProvider>
      <output>selected: {segmentGroup.value}</output>
    </div>
  )
}

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { SegmentGroup, useSegmentGroup } from '@ark-ui/solid/segment-group'
import { Index } from 'solid-js'
import styles from 'styles/segment-group.module.css'

export const RootProvider = () => {
  const frameworks = ['React', 'Solid', 'Svelte', 'Vue']
  const segmentGroup = useSegmentGroup({ defaultValue: 'React' })

  return (
    <div class="stack">
      <output>selected: {segmentGroup().value}</output>
      <SegmentGroup.RootProvider class={styles.Root} value={segmentGroup}>
        <SegmentGroup.Indicator class={styles.Indicator} />
        <Index each={frameworks}>
          {(framework) => (
            <SegmentGroup.Item class={styles.Item} value={framework()}>
              <SegmentGroup.ItemText class={styles.ItemText}>{framework()}</SegmentGroup.ItemText>
              <SegmentGroup.ItemControl class={styles.ItemControl} />
              <SegmentGroup.ItemHiddenInput />
            </SegmentGroup.Item>
          )}
        </Index>
      </SegmentGroup.RootProvider>
    </div>
  )
}

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { SegmentGroup, useSegmentGroup } from '@ark-ui/vue/segment-group'
import styles from 'styles/segment-group.module.css'

const frameworks = ['React', 'Solid', 'Svelte', 'Vue']

const segmentGroup = useSegmentGroup({ defaultValue: 'React' })
</script>

<template>
  <div class="stack">
    <output>selected: {{ segmentGroup.value }}</output>
    <SegmentGroup.RootProvider :class="styles.Root" :value="segmentGroup">
      <SegmentGroup.Indicator :class="styles.Indicator" />
      <SegmentGroup.Item v-for="framework in frameworks" :key="framework" :class="styles.Item" :value="framework">
        <SegmentGroup.ItemText :class="styles.ItemText">{{ framework }}</SegmentGroup.ItemText>
        <SegmentGroup.ItemControl :class="styles.ItemControl" />
        <SegmentGroup.ItemHiddenInput />
      </SegmentGroup.Item>
    </SegmentGroup.RootProvider>
  </div>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { SegmentGroup, useSegmentGroup } from '@ark-ui/svelte/segment-group'
  import styles from 'styles/segment-group.module.css'

  const frameworks = ['React', 'Solid', 'Svelte', 'Vue']

  const id = $props.id()
  const segmentGroup = useSegmentGroup({ id, defaultValue: 'React' })
</script>

<div class="stack">
  <output>selected: {segmentGroup().value}</output>
  <SegmentGroup.RootProvider class={styles.Root} value={segmentGroup}>
    <SegmentGroup.Indicator class={styles.Indicator} />
    {#each frameworks as framework}
      <SegmentGroup.Item class={styles.Item} value={framework}>
        <SegmentGroup.ItemText class={styles.ItemText}>{framework}</SegmentGroup.ItemText>
        <SegmentGroup.ItemControl class={styles.ItemControl} />
        <SegmentGroup.ItemHiddenInput />
      </SegmentGroup.Item>
    {/each}
  </SegmentGroup.RootProvider>
</div>

```

### Disabled

To disable a segment, simply pass the `disabled` prop to the `SegmentGroup.Item` component:

**Example: disabled**

#### React

```tsx
import { SegmentGroup } from '@ark-ui/react/segment-group'
import styles from 'styles/segment-group.module.css'

export const Disabled = () => {
  const frameworks = ['React', 'Solid', 'Svelte', 'Vue']
  return (
    <SegmentGroup.Root className={styles.Root} defaultValue="React">
      <SegmentGroup.Indicator className={styles.Indicator} />
      {frameworks.map((framework) => (
        <SegmentGroup.Item className={styles.Item} key={framework} value={framework} disabled={framework === 'Svelte'}>
          <SegmentGroup.ItemText className={styles.ItemText}>{framework}</SegmentGroup.ItemText>
          <SegmentGroup.ItemControl className={styles.ItemControl} />
          <SegmentGroup.ItemHiddenInput />
        </SegmentGroup.Item>
      ))}
    </SegmentGroup.Root>
  )
}

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { SegmentGroup } from '@ark-ui/solid/segment-group'
import { Index } from 'solid-js'
import styles from 'styles/segment-group.module.css'

export const Disabled = () => {
  const frameworks = ['React', 'Solid', 'Svelte', 'Vue']
  return (
    <SegmentGroup.Root class={styles.Root} defaultValue="React">
      <SegmentGroup.Indicator class={styles.Indicator} />

### Controlled

Use the `value` and `onValueChange` props to control the selected items.

**Example: controlled**

#### React

```tsx
import { Portal } from '@ark-ui/react/portal'
import { Select, createListCollection } from '@ark-ui/react/select'
import { ChevronsUpDownIcon, XIcon } from 'lucide-react'

import styles from 'styles/select.module.css'

interface Item {
  label: string
  value: string
  disabled?: boolean | undefined
}

export const Controlled = () => {
  const [value, setValue] = useState<string[]>([])

  const collection = createListCollection<Item>({
    items: [
      { label: 'React', value: 'react' },
      { label: 'Solid', value: 'solid' },
      { label: 'Vue', value: 'vue' },
      { label: 'Svelte', value: 'svelte', disabled: true },
    ],
  })

  const handleValueChange = (details: Select.ValueChangeDetails<Item>) => {
    setValue(details.value)
  }

  return (
    <Select.Root className={styles.Root} collection={collection} value={value} onValueChange={handleValueChange}>
      <Select.Label className={styles.Label}>Framework</Select.Label>
      <Select.Control className={styles.Control}>

  let value = $state<string[]>([])

  const collection = createListCollection<Item>({

        </Select.ItemGroup>
      </Select.Content>
    </Select.Positioner>
  </Portal>
  <Select.HiddenSelect />
</Select.Root>

```

### Root Provider

An alternative way to control the select is to use the `RootProvider` component and the `useSelect` hook. This way you
can access the state and methods from outside the component.

**Example: root-provider**

#### React

```tsx
import { Portal } from '@ark-ui/react/portal'
import { Select, createListCollection, useSelect } from '@ark-ui/react/select'
import { ChevronsUpDownIcon, XIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import styles from 'styles/select.module.css'

const frameworks = createListCollection({
  items: [
    { label: 'React', value: 'react' },
    { label: 'Solid', value: 'solid' },
    { label: 'Vue', value: 'vue' },

### Grouping

Grouping related options can be useful for organizing options into categories.

- Use the `groupBy` prop to configure the grouping of the items.
- Use the `collection.group()` method to get the grouped items.
- Use the `Select.ItemGroup` and `Select.ItemGroupLabel` components to render the grouped items.

**Example: grouping**

#### React

```tsx

    { label: 'Panda', value: 'panda', type: 'CSS' },
    { label: 'Tailwind', value: 'tailwind', type: 'CSS' },
  ],
  groupBy: (item) => item.type,
})

export const Grouping = () => {
  return (
    <Select.Root className={styles.Root} collection={frameworks}>
      <Select.Label className={styles.Label}>Framework</Select.Label>

### Field

Use `Field` to manage form state, ARIA labels, helper text, and error text.

**Example: with-field**

#### React

```tsx
import { Field } from '@ark-ui/react/field'
import { Select, createListCollection } from '@ark-ui/react/select'
import { ChevronsUpDownIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import field from 'styles/field.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/select.module.css'

export const WithField = () => {
  const collection = createListCollection({ items: ['React', 'Solid', 'Vue', 'Svelte'] })

  return (
    <Field.Root className={field.Root}>
      <Select.Root collection={collection} className={styles.Root}>
        <Select.Label className={styles.Label}>Label</Select.Label>
        <Select.Control className={styles.Control}>
          <Select.Trigger className={styles.Trigger}>
            <Select.ValueText className={styles.ValueText} placeholder="Select a Framework" />
            <Select.Indicator className={styles.Indicator}>
              <ChevronsUpDownIcon />
            </Select.Indicator>
          </Select.Trigger>
        </Select.Control>
        <Select.Positioner>
          <Select.Content className={styles.Content}>
            {collection.items.map((item) => (
              <Select.Item className={styles.Item} key={item} item={item}>
                <Select.ItemText className={styles.ItemText}>{item}</Select.ItemText>

### Form Usage

Here's an example of integrating the `Select` component with a form library.

**Example: form-library**

#### React

```tsx
import { Select, createListCollection } from '@ark-ui/react/select'
import { ChevronsUpDownIcon, XIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import { Controller, type SubmitHandler, useForm } from 'react-hook-form'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/select.module.css'

interface Inputs {
  framework: string
}

export const FormLibrary = () => {
  const { control, handleSubmit } = useForm<Inputs>({
    defaultValues: { framework: 'React' },
  })

  const collection = createListCollection({
    items: ['React', 'Solid', 'Vue', 'Svelte'],
  })

  const onSubmit: SubmitHandler<Inputs> = (data) => {
    window.alert(JSON.stringify(data))
  }

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit(onSubmit)}>
      <Controller
        name="framework"
        control={control}
        render={({ field }) => (
          <Select.Root
            className={styles.Root}
            collection={collection}
            value={field.value ? [field.value] : []}
            onValueChange={(e) => field.onChange(e.value[0])}
            name={field.name}
            onInteractOutside={() => field.onBlur()}
          >
            <Select.Label className={styles.Label}>Framework</Select.Label>
            <Select.HiddenSelect />
            <Select.Control className={styles.Control}>
              <Select.Trigger className={styles.Trigger}>
                <Select.ValueText className={styles.ValueText} placeholder="Select a Framework" />
              </Select.Trigger>
              <div className={styles.Indicators}>
                <Select.ClearTrigger className={styles.ClearTrigger}>
                  <XIcon />

                </Select.Indicator>
              </div>
            </Select.Control>
            <Select.Positioner>
              <Select.Content className={styles.Content}>
                <Select.ItemGroup className={styles.ItemGroup}>
                  <Select.ItemGroupLabel className={styles.ItemGroupLabel}>Frameworks</Select.ItemGroupLabel>
                  {collection.items.map((item) => (
                    <Select.Item className={styles.Item} key={item} item={item}>
                      <Select.ItemText className={styles.ItemText}>{item}</Select.ItemText>
                      <Select.ItemIndicator className={styles.ItemIndicator}>✓</Select.ItemIndicator>
                    </Select.Item>
                  ))}
                </Select.ItemGroup>
              </Select.Content>
            </Select.Positioner>
          </Select.Root>
        )}
      />

      <button className={button.Root} style={{ marginTop: '1rem' }} type="submit">
        Submit
      </button>
    </form>
  )
}

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Portal } from '@ark-ui/svelte/portal'

### Async Loading

Here's an example of how to load the items asynchronously when the select is opened.

**Example: async**

#### React

```tsx
import { Portal } from '@ark-ui/react/portal'
import { Select, createListCollection } from '@ark-ui/react/select'
import { ChevronsUpDownIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import { useState } from 'react'
import styles from 'styles/select.module.css'

function loadData() {
  return new Promise<string[]>((resolve) => {
    setTimeout(() => resolve(['React', 'Solid', 'Vue', 'Svelte', 'Angular', 'Ember']), 500)
  })
}

export const Async = () => {
  const [items, setItems] = useState<string[] | null>(null)
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false)
  const [error, setError] = useState<Error | null>(null)

  const collection = createListCollection<string>({
    items: items || [],
  })

  const handleOpenChange = (details: Select.OpenChangeDetails) => {
    if (details.open && items == null) {
      setLoading(true)
      setError(null)
      loadData()
        .then((data) => setItems(data))
        .catch((err) => setError(err))
        .finally(() => setLoading(false))
    }
  }

  return (
    <Select.Root className={styles.Root} collection={collection} onOpenChange={handleOpenChange}>
      <Select.Label className={styles.Label}>Framework</Select.Label>
      <Select.Control className={styles.Control}>
        <Select.Trigger className={styles.Trigger}>
          <Select.ValueText className={styles.ValueText} placeholder="Select" />
          <Select.Indicator className={styles.Indicator}>
            <ChevronsUpDownIcon />
          </Select.Indicator>
        </Select.Trigger>
      </Select.Control>
      <Portal>
        <Select.Positioner>
          <Select.Content className={styles.Content}>
            {loading ? (
              <div className={styles.Item}>Loading...</div>
            ) : error ? (
              <div className={styles.Item}>Error: {error.message}</div>
            ) : (
              collection.items.map((item) => (
                <Select.Item className={styles.Item} key={item} item={item}>
                  <Select.ItemText className={styles.ItemText}>{item}</Select.ItemText>
                  <Select.ItemIndicator className={styles.ItemIndicator}>✓</Select.ItemIndicator>
                </Select.Item>
              ))
            )}
          </Select.Content>
        </Select.Positioner>
      </Portal>
      <Select.HiddenSelect />
    </Select.Root>
  )
}

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Select, createListCollection } from '@ark-ui/solid/select'
import { ChevronsUpDownIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { Index, Match, Switch, createMemo, createSignal } from 'solid-js'

    setTimeout(() => resolve(['React', 'Solid', 'Vue', 'Svelte', 'Angular', 'Ember']), 500)
  })
}

export const Async = () => {
  const [items, setItems] = createSignal<string[] | null>(null)
  const [loading, setLoading] = createSignal(false)
  const [error, setError] = createSignal<Error | null>(null)

  const collection = createMemo(() =>
    createListCollection<string>({
      items: items() || [],
    }),
  )

  const handleOpenChange = (details: Select.OpenChangeDetails) => {
    if (details.open && items() === null) {
      setLoading(true)
      setError(null)
      loadData()
        .then((data) => setItems(data))
        .catch((err) => setError(err))
        .finally(() => setLoading(false))
    }
  }

  return (
    <Select.Root class={styles.Root} collection={collection()} onOpenChange={handleOpenChange}>
      <Select.Label class={styles.Label}>Framework</Select.Label>
      <Select.Control class={styles.Control}>

              <Match when={loading()}>
                <div class={styles.Item}>Loading...</div>
              </Match>
              <Match when={error()}>
                <div class={styles.Item}>Error: {error()?.message}</div>
              </Match>
              <Match when={items() !== null}>
                <Index each={collection().items}>
                  {(item) => (
                    <Select.Item class={styles.Item} item={item()}>
                      <Select.ItemText class={styles.ItemText}>{item()}</Select.ItemText>
                      <Select.ItemIndicator class={styles.ItemIndicator}>✓</Select.ItemIndicator>
                    </Select.Item>
                  )}
                </Index>
              </Match>
            </Switch>
          </Select.Content>
        </Select.Positioner>
      </Portal>
      <Select.HiddenSelect />

### Lazy Mount

Use `lazyMount` and `unmountOnExit` to control when content is mounted, improving performance.

**Example: lazy-mount**

#### React

```tsx
import { Portal } from '@ark-ui/react/portal'
import { Select, createListCollection } from '@ark-ui/react/select'
import { ChevronsUpDownIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import styles from 'styles/select.module.css'

export const LazyMount = () => {
  const collection = createListCollection({
    items: ['React', 'Solid', 'Vue', 'Svelte', 'Angular', 'Alpine'],
  })

  return (
    <Select.Root className={styles.Root} collection={collection} lazyMount unmountOnExit>
      <Select.Label className={styles.Label}>Framework</Select.Label>
      <Select.Control className={styles.Control}>
        <Select.Trigger className={styles.Trigger}>
          <Select.ValueText className={styles.ValueText} placeholder="Select a Framework" />
          <Select.Indicator className={styles.Indicator}>
            <ChevronsUpDownIcon />
          </Select.Indicator>
        </Select.Trigger>
        <Select.ClearTrigger className={styles.ClearTrigger}>Clear</Select.ClearTrigger>
      </Select.Control>
      <Portal>
        <Select.Positioner>
          <Select.Content className={styles.Content}>
            <Select.ItemGroup className={styles.ItemGroup}>
              <Select.ItemGroupLabel className={styles.ItemGroupLabel}>Frameworks</Select.ItemGroupLabel>
              {collection.items.map((item) => (
                <Select.Item className={styles.Item} key={item} item={item}>
                  <Select.ItemText className={styles.ItemText}>{item}</Select.ItemText>
                  <Select.ItemIndicator className={styles.ItemIndicator}>✓</Select.ItemIndicator>
                </Select.Item>
              ))}
            </Select.ItemGroup>
          </Select.Content>
        </Select.Positioner>
      </Portal>

              <Select.ItemGroupLabel class={styles.ItemGroupLabel}>Frameworks</Select.ItemGroupLabel>
              <Index each={collection.items}>
                {(item) => (
                  <Select.Item class={styles.Item} item={item()}>
                    <Select.ItemText class={styles.ItemText}>{item()}</Select.ItemText>
                    <Select.ItemIndicator class={styles.ItemIndicator}>✓</Select.ItemIndicator>
                  </Select.Item>
                )}
              </Index>
            </Select.ItemGroup>
          </Select.Content>
        </Select.Positioner>
      </Portal>
      <Select.HiddenSelect />
    </Select.Root>
  )
}

```

### Select on Highlight

Here's an example of automatically selecting items when they are highlighted (hovered or navigated to with keyboard).

**Example: select-on-highlight**

#### React

```tsx
import { Portal } from '@ark-ui/react/portal'
import { Select, createListCollection, useSelect } from '@ark-ui/react/select'
import { ChevronsUpDownIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import styles from 'styles/select.module.css'

export const SelectOnHighlight = () => {
  const collection = createListCollection({
    items: ['React', 'Solid', 'Vue', 'Svelte'],
  })

  const select = useSelect({
    collection,
    onHighlightChange({ highlightedValue }) {
      if (highlightedValue) {
        select.selectValue(highlightedValue)
      }
    },
  })

  return (
    <Select.RootProvider className={styles.Root} value={select}>
      <Select.Label className={styles.Label}>Framework</Select.Label>
      <Select.Control className={styles.Control}>
        <Select.Trigger className={styles.Trigger}>
          <Select.ValueText className={styles.ValueText} placeholder="Select a Framework" />
          <Select.Indicator className={styles.Indicator}>
            <ChevronsUpDownIcon />
          </Select.Indicator>
        </Select.Trigger>
        <Select.ClearTrigger className={styles.ClearTrigger}>Clear</Select.ClearTrigger>
      </Select.Control>
      <Portal>
        <Select.Positioner>
          <Select.Content className={styles.Content}>
            <Select.ItemGroup className={styles.ItemGroup}>
              <Select.ItemGroupLabel className={styles.ItemGroupLabel}>Frameworks</Select.ItemGroupLabel>
              {collection.items.map((item) => (
                <Select.Item className={styles.Item} key={item} item={item}>
                  <Select.ItemText className={styles.ItemText}>{item}</Select.ItemText>
                  <Select.ItemIndicator className={styles.ItemIndicator}>✓</Select.ItemIndicator>
                </Select.Item>
              ))}

### Max Selection

Here's an example of limiting the number of items that can be selected in a multiple select.

**Example: max-selected**

#### React

```tsx
import { Portal } from '@ark-ui/react/portal'
import { Select, createListCollection } from '@ark-ui/react/select'
import { ChevronsUpDownIcon, XIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import { useState } from 'react'
import styles from 'styles/select.module.css'

const items = ['React', 'Solid', 'Vue', 'Svelte']
const MAX_SELECTION = 2
const hasReachedMax = (value: string[]) => value.length >= MAX_SELECTION

export const MaxSelected = () => {
  const [value, setValue] = useState<string[]>([])

  const collection = createListCollection({
    items: items.map((item) => ({
      label: item,
      value: item,
      disabled: hasReachedMax(value) && !value.includes(item),
    })),
  })

  const handleValueChange = (details: Select.ValueChangeDetails) => {
    if (hasReachedMax(value) && details.value.length > value.length) return
    setValue(details.value)
  }

  return (
    <Select.Root
      className={styles.Root}
      collection={collection}
      multiple
      value={value}
      onValueChange={handleValueChange}
    >
      <Select.Label className={styles.Label}>Framework</Select.Label>
      <Select.Control className={styles.Control}>
        <Select.Trigger className={styles.Trigger}>

### Select All

Use `selectAll()` from the select context to select all items at once.

**Example: select-all**

#### React

```tsx
import { Portal } from '@ark-ui/react/portal'
import { Select, createListCollection } from '@ark-ui/react/select'
import { ChevronsUpDownIcon } from 'lucide-react'

import button from 'styles/button.module.css'

const SelectAllButton = () => {
  return (
    <Select.Context>
      {(api) => (
        <button
          className={button.Root}
          style={{ width: '100%', marginBottom: '0.25rem' }}
          type="button"
          onClick={() => {
            api.selectAll()
            api.setOpen(false)
          }}
        >
          Select All
        </button>
      )}
    </Select.Context>
  )
}

export const SelectAll = () => {
  const collection = createListCollection({ items: ['React', 'Solid', 'Vue', 'Svelte'] })

  return (
    <Select.Root className={styles.Root} collection={collection}>
      <Select.Label className={styles.Label}>Framework</Select.Label>
      <Select.Control className={styles.Control}>

### Overflow

For selects with many items, use `positioning.fitViewport` to ensure the dropdown fits within the viewport. Combine with
a max-height on the content to enable scrolling.

**Example: overflow**

#### React

```tsx
import { Portal } from '@ark-ui/react/portal'
import { Select, createListCollection } from '@ark-ui/react/select'
import { ChevronsUpDownIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import styles from 'styles/select.module.css'

export const Overflow = () => {
  const collection = createListCollection({
    items: [
      'Name 1',
      'Name 2',
      'Name 3',
      'Name 4',
      'Name 5',
      'Name 6',
      'Name 7',
      'Name 8',
      'Name 9',
      'Name 10',
      'Name 11',
      'Name 12',
      'Name 13',
      'Name 14',
    ],
  })

  return (
    <Select.Root
      className={styles.Root}
      collection={collection}
      positioning={{
        fitViewport: true,
        placement: 'bottom-start',
        sameWidth: true,
      }}
    >
      <Select.Label className={styles.Label}>Framework</Select.Label>
      <Select.Control className={styles.Control}>
        <Select.Trigger className={styles.Trigger}>
          <Select.ValueText className={styles.ValueText} placeholder="Select a Framework" />
          <Select.Indicator className={styles.Indicator}>
            <ChevronsUpDownIcon />
          </Select.Indicator>
        </Select.Trigger>
        <Select.ClearTrigger className={styles.ClearTrigger}>Clear</Select.ClearTrigger>
      </Select.Control>
      <Portal>
        <Select.Positioner>
          <Select.Content className={styles.Content} style={{ maxHeight: '200px' }}>
            <Select.ItemGroup className={styles.ItemGroup}>
              <Select.ItemGroupLabel className={styles.ItemGroupLabel}>Names</Select.ItemGroupLabel>
              {collection.items.map((item) => (
                <Select.Item className={styles.Item} key={item} item={item}>
                  <Select.ItemText className={styles.ItemText}>{item}</Select.ItemText>
                  <Select.ItemIndicator className={styles.ItemIndicator}>✓</Select.ItemIndicator>
                </Select.Item>
              ))}
            </Select.ItemGroup>
          </Select.Content>
        </Select.Positioner>
      </Portal>
      <Select.HiddenSelect />
    </Select.Root>
  )
}

```

## Guides

### Type Safety

The `Select.RootComponent` type enables you to create typed wrapper components that maintain full type safety for
collection items.

```tsx
const Select: ArkSelect.RootComponent = (props) => {
  return <ArkSelect.Root {...props}>{/* ... */}</ArkSelect.Root>
}
```

Use the wrapper with full type inference on `onValueChange` and other callbacks:

```tsx
const App = () => {
  const collection = createListCollection({
    initialItems: [
      { label: 'React', value: 'react' },
      { label: 'Vue', value: 'vue' },
    ],
  })
  return (
    <Select
      collection={collection}
      onValueChange={(e) => {
        // e.items is typed as Array<{ label: string, value: string }>
        console.log(e.items)
      }}
    >
      {/* ... */}
    </Select>
  )
}
```

### Nested Usage

When using the Select component within a `Popover` or `Dialog`, avoid rendering its content within a `Portal` or
`Teleport`.

This ensures the Select's content stays within the Popover/Dialog's DOM hierarchy rather than being portalled to the
document body, maintaining proper interaction and accessibility behavior.

### Hidden Select

The `Select.HiddenSelect` component renders a native HTML `<select>` element that's visually hidden but remains in the
DOM. This component is essential for:

- **Form submission**: Native form submission and serialization work seamlessly since the actual `<select>` element
  exists in the DOM
- **Browser auto-fill**: Browsers can properly auto-fill the select based on previously submitted form data
- **Progressive enhancement**: Forms remain functional even if JavaScript fails to load

```tsx
<Select.Root>
  <Select.HiddenSelect />
  {/* Other Select components */}
</Select.Root>
```

The hidden select automatically syncs with the Select component's value, ensuring form data is always up-to-date.

### Empty State

You can create an empty state component that displays when there are no items in the collection. Use the
`useSelectContext` hook to check the collection size:

```tsx
const SelectEmpty = (props: React.ComponentProps<'div'>) => {
  const select = useSelectContext()
  if (select.collection.size === 0) {
    return <div {...props} role="presentation" />
  }
  return null
}
```

Then use it within your Select content:

```tsx
<Select.Content>
  <SelectEmpty>No items to display</SelectEmpty>
  {/* Your items */}
</Select.Content>
```

### Available Size

The following css variables are exposed to the `Select.Positioner` which you can use to style the `Select.Content`

```css
/* width of the select trigger */
--reference-width: <pixel-value>;
/* width of the available viewport */
--available-width: <pixel-value>;
/* height of the available viewport */
--available-height: <pixel-value>;
```

For example, if you want to make sure the maximum height doesn't exceed the available height, you can use the following:

```css
[data-scope='select'][data-part='content'] {
  max-height: calc(var(--available-height) - 100px);
}
```

### Image Preview

After the user draws a signature, you can display a preview of the signature as an image. This is useful when you want
to show the user a preview of the signature before saving it.

**Example: image-preview**

#### React

```tsx
import { SignaturePad } from '@ark-ui/react/signature-pad'
import { RotateCcwIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import { useState } from 'react'
import styles from 'styles/signature-pad.module.css'

export const ImagePreview = () => {
  const [imageUrl, setImageUrl] = useState('')

  return (
    <div className="stack">
      <SignaturePad.Root
        className={styles.Root}
        onDrawEnd={(details) => details.getDataUrl('image/png').then((url) => setImageUrl(url))}
      >
        <SignaturePad.Label className={styles.Label}>Sign below</SignaturePad.Label>
        <SignaturePad.Control className={styles.Control}>
          <SignaturePad.Segment className={styles.Segment} />
          <SignaturePad.ClearTrigger className={styles.ClearTrigger}>
            <RotateCcwIcon />
          </SignaturePad.ClearTrigger>
          <SignaturePad.Guide className={styles.Guide} />
        </SignaturePad.Control>
      </SignaturePad.Root>

      <div className="stack">
        <span>Image Preview</span>
        {imageUrl && <img src={imageUrl} alt="Signature" className={styles.Image} />}
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { SignaturePad } from '@ark-ui/solid/signature-pad'
import { RotateCcwIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { Show, createSignal } from 'solid-js'
import styles from 'styles/signature-pad.module.css'

export const ImagePreview = () => {
  const [imageUrl, setImageUrl] = createSignal('')

  return (
    <div class="stack">
      <SignaturePad.Root
        class={styles.Root}
        onDrawEnd={(details) => details.getDataUrl('image/png').then((url) => setImageUrl(url))}
      >
        <SignaturePad.Label class={styles.Label}>Sign below</SignaturePad.Label>
        <SignaturePad.Control class={styles.Control}>

            <RotateCcwIcon />
          </SignaturePad.ClearTrigger>
          <SignaturePad.Guide class={styles.Guide} />
        </SignaturePad.Control>
      </SignaturePad.Root>

      <div class="stack">
        <span>Image Preview</span>
        <Show when={imageUrl()}>
          <img src={imageUrl()} alt="Signature" class={styles.Image} />
        </Show>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { SignaturePad, type SignaturePadDrawEndDetails } from '@ark-ui/vue/signature-pad'
import { RotateCcwIcon } from 'lucide-vue-next'
import { ref } from 'vue'
import styles from 'styles/signature-pad.module.css'

const imageUrl = ref('')

const handleDrawEnd = async (details: SignaturePadDrawEndDetails) => {
  imageUrl.value = await details.getDataUrl('image/png')
}
</script>

<template>
  <div class="stack">
    <SignaturePad.Root :class="styles.Root" @draw-end="handleDrawEnd">
      <SignaturePad.Label :class="styles.Label">Sign below</SignaturePad.Label>
      <SignaturePad.Control :class="styles.Control">
        <SignaturePad.Segment :class="styles.Segment" />
        <SignaturePad.ClearTrigger :class="styles.ClearTrigger">
          <RotateCcwIcon />
        </SignaturePad.ClearTrigger>
        <SignaturePad.Guide :class="styles.Guide" />
      </SignaturePad.Control>
    </SignaturePad.Root>

    <div class="stack">
      <span>Image Preview</span>
      <img v-if="imageUrl" :src="imageUrl" alt="Signature" :class="styles.Image" />
    </div>
  </div>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { SignaturePad } from '@ark-ui/svelte/signature-pad'
  import RotateCcwIcon from 'lucide-svelte/icons/rotate-ccw'
  import styles from 'styles/signature-pad.module.css'

  let imageUrl = $state('')
</script>

<div class="stack">
  <SignaturePad.Root

  <div class="stack">
    <span>Image Preview</span>
    {#if imageUrl}
      <img src={imageUrl} alt="Signature" class={styles.Image} />
    {/if}
  </div>
</div>

```

### Field

The `Field` component helps manage form-related state and accessibility attributes of a signature pad. It includes
handling ARIA labels, helper text, and error text to ensure proper accessibility.

**Example: with-field**

#### React

```tsx
import { Field } from '@ark-ui/react/field'
import { SignaturePad } from '@ark-ui/react/signature-pad'
import { RotateCcwIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import field from 'styles/field.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/signature-pad.module.css'

export const WithField = () => (
  <Field.Root className={field.Root}>
    <SignaturePad.Root className={styles.Root}>
      <SignaturePad.Label className={styles.Label}>Label</SignaturePad.Label>
      <SignaturePad.Control className={styles.Control}>
        <SignaturePad.Segment className={styles.Segment} />
        <SignaturePad.ClearTrigger className={styles.ClearTrigger}>
          <RotateCcwIcon />
        </SignaturePad.ClearTrigger>
        <SignaturePad.Guide className={styles.Guide} />
      </SignaturePad.Control>
    </SignaturePad.Root>
    <Field.HelperText className={field.HelperText}>Additional Info</Field.HelperText>
    <Field.ErrorText className={field.ErrorText}>Error Info</Field.ErrorText>
  </Field.Root>
)

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Field } from '@ark-ui/solid/field'
import { SignaturePad } from '@ark-ui/solid/signature-pad'
import { RotateCcwIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import field from 'styles/field.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/signature-pad.module.css'

export const WithField = () => (
  <Field.Root class={field.Root}>
    <SignaturePad.Root class={styles.Root}>
      <SignaturePad.Label class={styles.Label}>Label</SignaturePad.Label>
      <SignaturePad.Control class={styles.Control}>
        <SignaturePad.Segment class={styles.Segment} />
        <SignaturePad.ClearTrigger class={styles.ClearTrigger}>
          <RotateCcwIcon />
        </SignaturePad.ClearTrigger>
        <SignaturePad.Guide class={styles.Guide} />
      </SignaturePad.Control>
    </SignaturePad.Root>
    <Field.HelperText class={field.HelperText}>Additional Info</Field.HelperText>
    <Field.ErrorText class={field.ErrorText}>Error Info</Field.ErrorText>
  </Field.Root>
)

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Field } from '@ark-ui/vue/field'
import { SignaturePad } from '@ark-ui/vue/signature-pad'
import { RotateCcwIcon } from 'lucide-vue-next'
import field from 'styles/field.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/signature-pad.module.css'
</script>

<template>
  <Field.Root :class="field.Root">
    <SignaturePad.Root :class="styles.Root">
      <SignaturePad.Label :class="styles.Label">Label</SignaturePad.Label>
      <SignaturePad.Control :class="styles.Control">
        <SignaturePad.Segment :class="styles.Segment" />
        <SignaturePad.ClearTrigger :class="styles.ClearTrigger">
          <RotateCcwIcon />
        </SignaturePad.ClearTrigger>
        <SignaturePad.Guide :class="styles.Guide" />
      </SignaturePad.Control>
    </SignaturePad.Root>
    <Field.HelperText :class="field.HelperText">Additional Info</Field.HelperText>
    <Field.ErrorText :class="field.ErrorText">Error Info</Field.ErrorText>
  </Field.Root>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Field } from '@ark-ui/svelte/field'
  import { SignaturePad } from '@ark-ui/svelte/signature-pad'
  import RotateCcwIcon from 'lucide-svelte/icons/rotate-ccw'
  import field from 'styles/field.module.css'
  import styles from 'styles/signature-pad.module.css'
</script>

<Field.Root class={field.Root}>
  <SignaturePad.Root class={styles.Root}>
    <SignaturePad.Label class={styles.Label}>Label</SignaturePad.Label>
    <SignaturePad.Control class={styles.Control}>
      <SignaturePad.Segment class={styles.Segment} />
      <SignaturePad.ClearTrigger class={styles.ClearTrigger}>
        <RotateCcwIcon />
      </SignaturePad.ClearTrigger>
      <SignaturePad.Guide class={styles.Guide} />
    </SignaturePad.Control>
  </SignaturePad.Root>
  <Field.HelperText class={field.HelperText}>Additional Info</Field.HelperText>
  <Field.ErrorText class={field.ErrorText}>Error Info</Field.ErrorText>
</Field.Root>

```

### Root Provider

An alternative way to control the signature pad is to use the `RootProvider` component and the `useSignaturePad` hook.
This way you can access the state and methods from outside the component.

**Example: root-provider**

#### React

```tsx
import { SignaturePad, useSignaturePad } from '@ark-ui/react/signature-pad'
import { RotateCcwIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import styles from 'styles/signature-pad.module.css'

export const RootProvider = () => {
  const signaturePad = useSignaturePad()

  return (
    <div className="stack">
      <output>no of paths: {signaturePad.paths.length}</output>
      <SignaturePad.RootProvider className={styles.Root} value={signaturePad}>
        <SignaturePad.Label className={styles.Label}>Sign below</SignaturePad.Label>
        <SignaturePad.Control className={styles.Control}>
          <SignaturePad.Segment className={styles.Segment} />
          <SignaturePad.ClearTrigger className={styles.ClearTrigger}>

  import { Slider } from '@ark-ui/svelte/slider'
  import styles from 'styles/slider.module.css'
</script>

<Slider.Root defaultValue={[30, 60]} class={styles.Root}>
  <Slider.Label class={styles.Label}>Label</Slider.Label>
  <Slider.Control class={styles.Control}>
    <Slider.Track class={styles.Track}>
      <Slider.Range class={styles.Range} />
    </Slider.Track>
    <Slider.Thumb index={0} class={styles.Thumb}>
      <Slider.HiddenInput />
    </Slider.Thumb>
    <Slider.Thumb index={1} class={styles.Thumb}>
      <Slider.HiddenInput />
    </Slider.Thumb>
  </Slider.Control>
</Slider.Root>

```

### Marks

You can add marks to the slider track by using the `Slider.MarkerGroup` and `Slider.Marker` components.

Position the `Slider.Marker` components relative to the track by providing the `value` prop.

**Example: with-marks**

#### React

```tsx
import { Slider } from '@ark-ui/react/slider'
import styles from 'styles/slider.module.css'

export const WithMarks = () => {
  return (
    <Slider.Root className={styles.Root} defaultValue={[50]}>
      <div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'space-between' }}>
        <Slider.Label className={styles.Label}>Label</Slider.Label>
        <Slider.ValueText className={styles.ValueText} />
      </div>
      <Slider.Control className={styles.Control}>
        <Slider.Track className={styles.Track}>
          <Slider.Range className={styles.Range} />
        </Slider.Track>
        <Slider.Thumb index={0} className={styles.Thumb}>
          <Slider.HiddenInput />
        </Slider.Thumb>
      </Slider.Control>
      <Slider.MarkerGroup className={styles.MarkerGroup}>
        {[0, 25, 50, 75, 100].map((value) => (
          <Slider.Marker key={value} value={value} className={styles.Marker}>
            {value}
          </Slider.Marker>
        ))}
      </Slider.MarkerGroup>
    </Slider.Root>
  )
}

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Slider } from '@ark-ui/solid/slider'
import { For } from 'solid-js'
import styles from 'styles/slider.module.css'

export const WithMarks = () => {
  return (
    <Slider.Root class={styles.Root} defaultValue={[50]}>
      <div style={{ display: 'flex', 'justify-content': 'space-between' }}>
        <Slider.Label class={styles.Label}>Label</Slider.Label>
        <Slider.ValueText class={styles.ValueText} />
      </div>
      <Slider.Control class={styles.Control}>
        <Slider.Track class={styles.Track}>
          <Slider.Range class={styles.Range} />
        </Slider.Track>
        <Slider.Thumb index={0} class={styles.Thumb}>
          <Slider.HiddenInput />
        </Slider.Thumb>
      </Slider.Control>
      <Slider.MarkerGroup class={styles.MarkerGroup}>
        <For each={[0, 25, 50, 75, 100]}>
          {(value) => (
            <Slider.Marker value={value} class={styles.Marker}>
              {value}
            </Slider.Marker>
          )}
        </For>
      </Slider.MarkerGroup>
    </Slider.Root>
  )
}

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Slider } from '@ark-ui/vue/slider'
import styles from 'styles/slider.module.css'

const marks = [0, 25, 50, 75, 100]
</script>

<template>
  <Slider.Root :class="styles.Root" :default-value="[50]">
    <div :style="{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'space-between' }">
      <Slider.Label :class="styles.Label">Label</Slider.Label>
      <Slider.ValueText :class="styles.ValueText" />
    </div>
    <Slider.Control :class="styles.Control">

        {{ value }}
      </Slider.Marker>
    </Slider.MarkerGroup>
  </Slider.Root>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Slider } from '@ark-ui/svelte/slider'
  import styles from 'styles/slider.module.css'

  const marks = [0, 25, 50, 75, 100]
</script>

<Slider.Root class={styles.Root} defaultValue={[50]}>
  <div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between;">
    <Slider.Label class={styles.Label}>Label</Slider.Label>
    <Slider.ValueText class={styles.ValueText} />
  </div>
  <Slider.Control class={styles.Control}>
    <Slider.Track class={styles.Track}>
      <Slider.Range class={styles.Range} />
    </Slider.Track>
    <Slider.Thumb index={0} class={styles.Thumb}>
      <Slider.HiddenInput />
    </Slider.Thumb>
  </Slider.Control>
  <Slider.MarkerGroup class={styles.MarkerGroup}>
    {#each marks as value}
      <Slider.Marker {value} class={styles.Marker}>{value}</Slider.Marker>
    {/each}
  </Slider.MarkerGroup>
</Slider.Root>

```

### Min and Max

By default, the minimum is `0` and the maximum is `100`. If that's not what you want, you can easily specify different
bounds by changing the values of the `min` and/or `max` props.

For example, to ask the user for a value between `-10` and `10`, you can use:

**Example: min-max**

#### React

```tsx
import { Slider } from '@ark-ui/react/slider'
import styles from 'styles/slider.module.css'

export const MinMax = () => {
  return (
    <Slider.Root min={-10} max={10} defaultValue={[5]} className={styles.Root}>
      <div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'space-between' }}>
        <Slider.Label className={styles.Label}>Label</Slider.Label>
        <Slider.ValueText className={styles.ValueText} />
      </div>
      <Slider.Control className={styles.Control}>
        <Slider.Track className={styles.Track}>
          <Slider.Range className={styles.Range} />
        </Slider.Track>
        <Slider.Thumb index={0} className={styles.Thumb}>
          <Slider.HiddenInput />
        </Slider.Thumb>
      </Slider.Control>
    </Slider.Root>
  )
}

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Slider } from '@ark-ui/solid/slider'
import styles from 'styles/slider.module.css'

export const MinMax = () => {
  return (
    <Slider.Root min={-10} max={10} defaultValue={[5]} class={styles.Root}>
      <div style={{ display: 'flex', 'justify-content': 'space-between' }}>
        <Slider.Label class={styles.Label}>Label</Slider.Label>
        <Slider.ValueText class={styles.ValueText} />
      </div>
      <Slider.Control class={styles.Control}>
        <Slider.Track class={styles.Track}>
          <Slider.Range class={styles.Range} />
        </Slider.Track>
        <Slider.Thumb index={0} class={styles.Thumb}>
          <Slider.HiddenInput />
        </Slider.Thumb>
      </Slider.Control>
    </Slider.Root>
  )
}

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Slider } from '@ark-ui/vue/slider'
import styles from 'styles/slider.module.css'
</script>

<template>
  <Slider.Root :min="-10" :max="10" :default-value="[5]" :class="styles.Root">
    <div :style="{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'space-between' }">
      <Slider.Label :class="styles.Label">Label</Slider.Label>
      <Slider.ValueText :class="styles.ValueText" />
    </div>
    <Slider.Control :class="styles.Control">
      <Slider.Track :class="styles.Track">
        <Slider.Range :class="styles.Range" />
      </Slider.Track>
      <Slider.Thumb :index="0" :class="styles.Thumb">
        <Slider.HiddenInput />
      </Slider.Thumb>
    </Slider.Control>
  </Slider.Root>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Slider } from '@ark-ui/svelte/slider'
  import styles from 'styles/slider.module.css'
</script>

<Slider.Root min={-10} max={10} defaultValue={[5]} class={styles.Root}>
  <div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between;">
    <Slider.Label class={styles.Label}>Label</Slider.Label>
    <Slider.ValueText class={styles.ValueText} />
  </div>
  <Slider.Control class={styles.Control}>
    <Slider.Track class={styles.Track}>
      <Slider.Range class={styles.Range} />
    </Slider.Track>
    <Slider.Thumb index={0} class={styles.Thumb}>
      <Slider.HiddenInput />
    </Slider.Thumb>
  </Slider.Control>
</Slider.Root>

```

### Granularity

By default, the granularity, is `1`, meaning that the value is always an integer. You can change the step attribute to
control the granularity.

For example, If you need a value between `5` and `10`, accurate to two decimal places, you should set the value of step
to `0.01`:

**Example: step**

#### React

```tsx
import { Slider } from '@ark-ui/react/slider'
import styles from 'styles/slider.module.css'

export const Step = () => {
  return (
    <Slider.Root step={0.01} min={5} max={10} defaultValue={[7.5]} className={styles.Root}>
      <div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'space-between' }}>
        <Slider.Label className={styles.Label}>Label</Slider.Label>
        <Slider.ValueText className={styles.ValueText} />
      </div>
      <Slider.Control className={styles.Control}>
        <Slider.Track className={styles.Track}>
          <Slider.Range className={styles.Range} />
        </Slider.Track>
        <Slider.Thumb index={0} className={styles.Thumb}>
          <Slider.HiddenInput />
        </Slider.Thumb>
      </Slider.Control>
    </Slider.Root>
  )
}

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Slider } from '@ark-ui/solid/slider'
import styles from 'styles/slider.module.css'

export const Step = () => {
  return (
    <Slider.Root step={0.01} min={5} max={10} defaultValue={[7.5]} class={styles.Root}>
      <div style={{ display: 'flex', 'justify-content': 'space-between' }}>
        <Slider.Label class={styles.Label}>Label</Slider.Label>
        <Slider.ValueText class={styles.ValueText} />
      </div>
      <Slider.Control class={styles.Control}>
        <Slider.Track class={styles.Track}>
          <Slider.Range class={styles.Range} />
        </Slider.Track>
        <Slider.Thumb index={0} class={styles.Thumb}>
          <Slider.HiddenInput />
        </Slider.Thumb>
      </Slider.Control>
    </Slider.Root>
  )
}

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Slider } from '@ark-ui/vue/slider'
import styles from 'styles/slider.module.css'
</script>

<template>
  <Slider.Root :step="0.01" :min="5" :max="10" :default-value="[7.5]" :class="styles.Root">
    <div :style="{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'space-between' }">
      <Slider.Label :class="styles.Label">Label</Slider.Label>
      <Slider.ValueText :class="styles.ValueText" />
    </div>
    <Slider.Control :class="styles.Control">
      <Slider.Track :class="styles.Track">
        <Slider.Range :class="styles.Range" />
      </Slider.Track>
      <Slider.Thumb :index="0" :class="styles.Thumb">
        <Slider.HiddenInput />
      </Slider.Thumb>
    </Slider.Control>
  </Slider.Root>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Slider } from '@ark-ui/svelte/slider'
  import styles from 'styles/slider.module.css'
</script>

<Slider.Root step={0.01} min={5} max={10} defaultValue={[7.5]} class={styles.Root}>
  <div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between;">
    <Slider.Label class={styles.Label}>Label</Slider.Label>
    <Slider.ValueText class={styles.ValueText} />
  </div>
  <Slider.Control class={styles.Control}>
    <Slider.Track class={styles.Track}>
      <Slider.Range class={styles.Range} />
    </Slider.Track>
    <Slider.Thumb index={0} class={styles.Thumb}>
      <Slider.HiddenInput />
    </Slider.Thumb>
  </Slider.Control>
</Slider.Root>

```

### Change Events

When the slider value changes, the `onValueChange` and `onValueChangeEnd` callbacks are invoked. You can use this to set
up custom behaviors in your app.

**Example: on-event**

#### React

```tsx
import { Slider } from '@ark-ui/react/slider'
import styles from 'styles/slider.module.css'

export const OnEvent = () => {
  return (
    <Slider.Root
      onValueChange={(details) => console.log('onValueChange', details.value)}
      onValueChangeEnd={(details) => console.log('onValueChangeEnd', details.value)}
      className={styles.Root}
    >
      <div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'space-between' }}>
        <Slider.Label className={styles.Label}>Label</Slider.Label>
        <Slider.ValueText className={styles.ValueText} />
      </div>
      <Slider.Control className={styles.Control}>
        <Slider.Track className={styles.Track}>
          <Slider.Range className={styles.Range} />
        </Slider.Track>
        <Slider.Thumb index={0} className={styles.Thumb}>
          <Slider.HiddenInput />
        </Slider.Thumb>
      </Slider.Control>
    </Slider.Root>
  )
}

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Slider } from '@ark-ui/solid/slider'
import styles from 'styles/slider.module.css'

export const OnEvent = () => {
  return (
    <Slider.Root
      onValueChange={(details) => console.log('onValueChange', details.value)}
      onValueChangeEnd={(details) => console.log('onValueChangeEnd', details.value)}
      class={styles.Root}
    >
      <div style={{ display: 'flex', 'justify-content': 'space-between' }}>
        <Slider.Label class={styles.Label}>Label</Slider.Label>
        <Slider.ValueText class={styles.ValueText} />
      </div>
      <Slider.Control class={styles.Control}>
        <Slider.Track class={styles.Track}>
          <Slider.Range class={styles.Range} />
        </Slider.Track>
        <Slider.Thumb index={0} class={styles.Thumb}>
          <Slider.HiddenInput />
        </Slider.Thumb>
      </Slider.Control>
    </Slider.Root>
  )
}

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Slider } from '@ark-ui/vue/slider'
import styles from 'styles/slider.module.css'
</script>

<template>
  <Slider.Root
    :class="styles.Root"
    @value-change="(details) => console.log('onValueChange', details.value)"
    @value-change-end="(details) => console.log('onValueChangeEnd', details.value)"
  >
    <div :style="{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'space-between' }">
      <Slider.Label :class="styles.Label">Label</Slider.Label>
      <Slider.ValueText :class="styles.ValueText" />
    </div>
    <Slider.Control :class="styles.Control">
      <Slider.Track :class="styles.Track">
        <Slider.Range :class="styles.Range" />
      </Slider.Track>
      <Slider.Thumb :index="0" :class="styles.Thumb">
        <Slider.HiddenInput />
      </Slider.Thumb>
    </Slider.Control>
  </Slider.Root>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Slider, type SliderValueChangeDetails } from '@ark-ui/svelte/slider'
  import styles from 'styles/slider.module.css'

  const handleValueChange = (details: SliderValueChangeDetails) => {
    console.log('onValueChange', details.value)
  }

  const handleValueChangeEnd = (details: SliderValueChangeDetails) => {
    console.log('onValueChangeEnd', details.value)
  }
</script>

<Slider.Root class={styles.Root} onValueChange={handleValueChange} onValueChangeEnd={handleValueChangeEnd}>
  <div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between;">
    <Slider.Label class={styles.Label}>Label</Slider.Label>
    <Slider.ValueText class={styles.ValueText} />
  </div>
  <Slider.Control class={styles.Control}>
    <Slider.Track class={styles.Track}>
      <Slider.Range class={styles.Range} />
    </Slider.Track>
    <Slider.Thumb index={0} class={styles.Thumb}>
      <Slider.HiddenInput />
    </Slider.Thumb>
  </Slider.Control>
</Slider.Root>

```

### Orientation

By default, the slider is assumed to be horizontal. To change the orientation to vertical, set the orientation property
in the machine's context to vertical.

In this mode, the slider will use the arrow up and down keys to increment/decrement its value.

> Don't forget to change the styles of the vertical slider by specifying its height

**Example: vertical**

#### React

```tsx
import { Slider } from '@ark-ui/react/slider'
import styles from 'styles/slider.module.css'

export const Vertical = () => {
  return (
    <Slider.Root orientation="vertical" className={styles.Root}>
      <Slider.Label className={styles.Label}>Label</Slider.Label>
      <Slider.ValueText className={styles.ValueText} />
      <Slider.Control className={styles.Control}>
        <Slider.Track className={styles.Track}>
          <Slider.Range className={styles.Range} />
        </Slider.Track>
        <Slider.Thumb index={0} className={styles.Thumb}>
          <Slider.HiddenInput />
        </Slider.Thumb>
      </Slider.Control>
    </Slider.Root>
  )
}

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Slider } from '@ark-ui/solid/slider'
import styles from 'styles/slider.module.css'

export const Vertical = () => {
  return (
    <Slider.Root orientation="vertical" class={styles.Root}>
      <Slider.Label class={styles.Label}>Label</Slider.Label>
      <Slider.ValueText class={styles.ValueText} />
      <Slider.Control class={styles.Control}>
        <Slider.Track class={styles.Track}>
          <Slider.Range class={styles.Range} />
        </Slider.Track>
        <Slider.Thumb index={0} class={styles.Thumb}>
          <Slider.HiddenInput />
        </Slider.Thumb>
      </Slider.Control>
    </Slider.Root>
  )
}

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Slider } from '@ark-ui/vue/slider'
import styles from 'styles/slider.module.css'
</script>

<template>
  <Slider.Root orientation="vertical" :class="styles.Root">
    <Slider.Label :class="styles.Label">Label</Slider.Label>
    <Slider.ValueText :class="styles.ValueText" />
    <Slider.Control :class="styles.Control">
      <Slider.Track :class="styles.Track">
        <Slider.Range :class="styles.Range" />

        <Slider.HiddenInput />
      </Slider.Thumb>
    </Slider.Control>
  </Slider.Root>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Slider } from '@ark-ui/svelte/slider'
  import styles from 'styles/slider.module.css'
</script>

<Slider.Root orientation="vertical" class={styles.Root}>
  <Slider.Label class={styles.Label}>Label</Slider.Label>
  <Slider.ValueText class={styles.ValueText} />
  <Slider.Control class={styles.Control}>
    <Slider.Track class={styles.Track}>
      <Slider.Range class={styles.Range} />
    </Slider.Track>
    <Slider.Thumb index={0} class={styles.Thumb}>
      <Slider.HiddenInput />
    </Slider.Thumb>
  </Slider.Control>
</Slider.Root>

```

### Origin

By default, the slider's origin is at the start of the track. To change the origin to the center of the track, set the
`origin` prop to `center`.

**Example: center-origin**

#### React

```tsx
import { Slider } from '@ark-ui/react/slider'
import styles from 'styles/slider.module.css'

export const CenterOrigin = () => {
  return (
    <Slider.Root origin="center" className={styles.Root} defaultValue={[75]}>
      <div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'space-between' }}>
        <Slider.Label className={styles.Label}>Label</Slider.Label>
        <Slider.ValueText className={styles.ValueText} />
      </div>
      <Slider.Control className={styles.Control}>
        <Slider.Track className={styles.Track}>
          <Slider.Range className={styles.Range} />
        </Slider.Track>
        <Slider.Thumb index={0} className={styles.Thumb}>
          <Slider.HiddenInput />
        </Slider.Thumb>
      </Slider.Control>
    </Slider.Root>
  )
}

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Slider } from '@ark-ui/solid/slider'
import styles from 'styles/slider.module.css'

export const CenterOrigin = () => {
  return (
    <Slider.Root origin="center" class={styles.Root} defaultValue={[75]}>
      <div style={{ display: 'flex', 'justify-content': 'space-between' }}>
        <Slider.Label class={styles.Label}>Label</Slider.Label>
        <Slider.ValueText class={styles.ValueText} />
      </div>
      <Slider.Control class={styles.Control}>
        <Slider.Track class={styles.Track}>
          <Slider.Range class={styles.Range} />
        </Slider.Track>
        <Slider.Thumb index={0} class={styles.Thumb}>
          <Slider.HiddenInput />
        </Slider.Thumb>
      </Slider.Control>
    </Slider.Root>
  )
}

```

#### Vue

```vue

        <Slider.Range :class="styles.Range" />
      </Slider.Track>
      <Slider.Thumb :index="0" :class="styles.Thumb">
        <Slider.HiddenInput />
      </Slider.Thumb>
    </Slider.Control>
  </Slider.Root>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Slider } from '@ark-ui/svelte/slider'
  import styles from 'styles/slider.module.css'
</script>

<Slider.Root origin="center" class={styles.Root} defaultValue={[75]}>
  <div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between;">
    <Slider.Label class={styles.Label}>Label</Slider.Label>
    <Slider.ValueText class={styles.ValueText} />
  </div>
  <Slider.Control class={styles.Control}>
    <Slider.Track class={styles.Track}>
      <Slider.Range class={styles.Range} />
    </Slider.Track>
    <Slider.Thumb index={0} class={styles.Thumb}>
      <Slider.HiddenInput />
    </Slider.Thumb>
  </Slider.Control>
</Slider.Root>

```

### Root Provider

An alternative way to control the slider is to use the `RootProvider` component and the `useSlider` hook. This way you
can access the state and methods from outside the component.

**Example: root-provider**

#### React

```tsx
import { Slider, useSlider } from '@ark-ui/react/slider'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/slider.module.css'

export const RootProvider = () => {
  const slider = useSlider()

  return (
    <>
      <button className={button.Root} onClick={() => slider.focus()}>
        Focus
      </button>

      <Slider.RootProvider value={slider} className={styles.Root}>
        <Slider.Label className={styles.Label}>Label</Slider.Label>
        <Slider.ValueText className={styles.ValueText} />
        <Slider.Control className={styles.Control}>
          <Slider.Track className={styles.Track}>
            <Slider.Range className={styles.Range} />
          </Slider.Track>
          <Slider.Thumb index={0} className={styles.Thumb}>
            <Slider.HiddenInput />
          </Slider.Thumb>
        </Slider.Control>
      </Slider.RootProvider>
    </>
  )
}

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Slider, useSlider } from '@ark-ui/solid/slider'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/slider.module.css'

export const RootProvider = () => {
  const slider = useSlider()

  return (
    <>
      <button class={button.Root} onClick={() => slider().focus()}>
        Focus
      </button>

      <Slider.RootProvider value={slider} class={styles.Root}>
        <Slider.Label class={styles.Label}>Label</Slider.Label>
        <Slider.ValueText class={styles.ValueText} />
        <Slider.Control class={styles.Control}>
          <Slider.Track class={styles.Track}>
            <Slider.Range class={styles.Range} />
          </Slider.Track>
          <Slider.Thumb index={0} class={styles.Thumb}>
            <Slider.HiddenInput />
          </Slider.Thumb>
        </Slider.Control>
      </Slider.RootProvider>
    </>
  )
}

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Slider, useSlider } from '@ark-ui/vue/slider'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/slider.module.css'

const slider = useSlider()
</script>

<template>
  <button :class="button.Root" @click="slider.focus()">Focus</button>

  <Slider.RootProvider :value="slider" :class="styles.Root">
    <Slider.Label :class="styles.Label">Label</Slider.Label>
    <Slider.ValueText :class="styles.ValueText" />
    <Slider.Control :class="styles.Control">
      <Slider.Track :class="styles.Track">
        <Slider.Range :class="styles.Range" />
      </Slider.Track>
      <Slider.Thumb :index="0" :class="styles.Thumb">
        <Slider.HiddenInput />
      </Slider.Thumb>
    </Slider.Control>
  </Slider.RootProvider>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Slider, useSlider } from '@ark-ui/svelte/slider'
  import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
  import styles from 'styles/slider.module.css'

  const id = $props.id()
  const slider = useSlider({ id })
</script>

<button class={button.Root} onclick={() => slider().focus()}>Focus</button>

<Slider.RootProvider value={slider} class={styles.Root}>
  <Slider.Label class={styles.Label}>Label</Slider.Label>
  <Slider.ValueText class={styles.ValueText} />
  <Slider.Control class={styles.Control}>
    <Slider.Track class={styles.Track}>
      <Slider.Range class={styles.Range} />
    </Slider.Track>
    <Slider.Thumb index={0} class={styles.Thumb}>
      <Slider.HiddenInput />
    </Slider.Thumb>
  </Slider.Control>
</Slider.RootProvider>

```

### Dragging Indicator

Use the `Slider.DraggingIndicator` component inside `Slider.Thumb` to show a visual indicator while the thumb is being
dragged.

**Example: dragging-indicator**

#### React

```tsx
import { Slider } from '@ark-ui/react/slider'
import styles from 'styles/slider.module.css'

export const DraggingIndicator = () => {
  return (
    <Slider.Root className={styles.Root} defaultValue={[40]}>
      <Slider.Label className={styles.Label}>Label</Slider.Label>
      <Slider.Control className={styles.Control}>
        <Slider.Track className={styles.Track}>
          <Slider.Range className={styles.Range} />
        </Slider.Track>
        <Slider.Thumb index={0} className={styles.Thumb}>
          <Slider.DraggingIndicator className={styles.DraggingIndicator} />
          <Slider.HiddenInput />
        </Slider.Thumb>
      </Slider.Control>
    </Slider.Root>
  )
}

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Slider } from '@ark-ui/solid/slider'
import styles from 'styles/slider.module.css'

export const DraggingIndicator = () => {
  return (
    <Slider.Root class={styles.Root} defaultValue={[40]}>
      <Slider.Label class={styles.Label}>Label</Slider.Label>
      <Slider.Control class={styles.Control}>
        <Slider.Track class={styles.Track}>
          <Slider.Range class={styles.Range} />
        </Slider.Track>
        <Slider.Thumb index={0} class={styles.Thumb}>
          <Slider.DraggingIndicator class={styles.DraggingIndicator} />
          <Slider.HiddenInput />
        </Slider.Thumb>
      </Slider.Control>
    </Slider.Root>
  )
}

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Slider } from '@ark-ui/vue/slider'
import styles from 'styles/slider.module.css'
</script>

<template>
  <Slider.Root :class="styles.Root" :default-value="[40]">
    <Slider.Label :class="styles.Label">Label</Slider.Label>
    <Slider.Control :class="styles.Control">
      <Slider.Track :class="styles.Track">
        <Slider.Range :class="styles.Range" />
      </Slider.Track>
      <Slider.Thumb :index="0" :class="styles.Thumb">
        <Slider.DraggingIndicator :class="styles.DraggingIndicator" />
        <Slider.HiddenInput />
      </Slider.Thumb>
    </Slider.Control>
  </Slider.Root>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Slider } from '@ark-ui/svelte/slider'
  import styles from 'styles/slider.module.css'
</script>

<Slider.Root class={styles.Root} defaultValue={[40]}>
  <Slider.Label class={styles.Label}>Label</Slider.Label>
  <Slider.Control class={styles.Control}>
    <Slider.Track class={styles.Track}>
      <Slider.Range class={styles.Range} />
    </Slider.Track>
    <Slider.Thumb index={0} class={styles.Thumb}>
      <Slider.DraggingIndicator class={styles.DraggingIndicator} />
      <Slider.HiddenInput />
    </Slider.Thumb>
  </Slider.Control>
</Slider.Root>

```

### Thumb Overlap

Use the `minStepsBetweenThumbs` prop to prevent range slider thumbs from overlapping. This ensures a minimum gap between
thumbs, which is useful for price range filters and similar use cases.

**Example: thumb-overlap**

#### React

```tsx
import { Slider } from '@ark-ui/react/slider'
import styles from 'styles/slider.module.css'

export const ThumbOverlap = () => {
  return (
    <Slider.Root minStepsBetweenThumbs={5} defaultValue={[25, 60]} className={styles.Root}>
      <div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'space-between' }}>
        <Slider.Label className={styles.Label}>Label</Slider.Label>
        <Slider.ValueText className={styles.ValueText} />
      </div>
      <Slider.Control className={styles.Control}>
        <Slider.Track className={styles.Track}>
          <Slider.Range className={styles.Range} />
        </Slider.Track>
        <Slider.Thumb index={0} className={styles.Thumb}>
          <Slider.HiddenInput />
        </Slider.Thumb>
        <Slider.Thumb index={1} className={styles.Thumb}>
          <Slider.HiddenInput />
        </Slider.Thumb>
      </Slider.Control>
    </Slider.Root>
  )
}

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Slider } from '@ark-ui/solid/slider'
import styles from 'styles/slider.module.css'

export const ThumbOverlap = () => {
  return (
    <Slider.Root minStepsBetweenThumbs={5} defaultValue={[25, 60]} class={styles.Root}>
      <div style={{ display: 'flex', 'justify-content': 'space-between' }}>
        <Slider.Label class={styles.Label}>Label</Slider.Label>
        <Slider.ValueText class={styles.ValueText} />
      </div>
      <Slider.Control class={styles.Control}>
        <Slider.Track class={styles.Track}>
          <Slider.Range class={styles.Range} />
        </Slider.Track>
        <Slider.Thumb index={0} class={styles.Thumb}>
          <Slider.HiddenInput />
        </Slider.Thumb>
        <Slider.Thumb index={1} class={styles.Thumb}>
          <Slider.HiddenInput />
        </Slider.Thumb>
      </Slider.Control>
    </Slider.Root>
  )
}

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Slider } from '@ark-ui/vue/slider'
import styles from 'styles/slider.module.css'
</script>

<template>
  <Slider.Root :min-steps-between-thumbs="5" :default-value="[25, 60]" :class="styles.Root">
    <div :style="{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'space-between' }">
      <Slider.Label :class="styles.Label">Label</Slider.Label>
      <Slider.ValueText :class="styles.ValueText" />
    </div>
    <Slider.Control :class="styles.Control">

        <Slider.HiddenInput />
      </Slider.Thumb>
    </Slider.Control>
  </Slider.Root>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Slider } from '@ark-ui/svelte/slider'
  import styles from 'styles/slider.module.css'
</script>

<Slider.Root minStepsBetweenThumbs={5} defaultValue={[25, 60]} class={styles.Root}>
  <div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between;">
    <Slider.Label class={styles.Label}>Label</Slider.Label>
    <Slider.ValueText class={styles.ValueText} />
  </div>

# Splitter



## Anatomy



```tsx
<Splitter.Root>
  <Splitter.Panel />
  <Splitter.ResizeTrigger>
    <Splitter.ResizeTriggerIndicator />
  </Splitter.ResizeTrigger>
  <Splitter.Panel />
</Splitter.Root>
```

## Examples

**Example: basic**

#### React

```tsx
import { Splitter } from '@ark-ui/react/splitter'
import styles from 'styles/splitter.module.css'

export const Basic = () => (
  <Splitter.Root className={styles.Root} panels={[{ id: 'a' }, { id: 'b' }]}>
    <Splitter.Panel className={styles.Panel} id="a">
      A
    </Splitter.Panel>
    <Splitter.ResizeTrigger className={styles.ResizeTrigger} id="a:b" aria-label="Resize">
      <Splitter.ResizeTriggerIndicator className={styles.ResizeTriggerIndicator} />
    </Splitter.ResizeTrigger>
    <Splitter.Panel className={styles.Panel} id="b">
      B
    </Splitter.Panel>
  </Splitter.Root>
)

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Splitter } from '@ark-ui/solid/splitter'
import styles from 'styles/splitter.module.css'

export const Basic = () => (
  <Splitter.Root class={styles.Root} panels={[{ id: 'a' }, { id: 'b' }]}>
    <Splitter.Panel class={styles.Panel} id="a">
      A
    </Splitter.Panel>
    <Splitter.ResizeTrigger class={styles.ResizeTrigger} id="a:b" aria-label="Resize">
      <Splitter.ResizeTriggerIndicator class={styles.ResizeTriggerIndicator} />
    </Splitter.ResizeTrigger>
    <Splitter.Panel class={styles.Panel} id="b">
      B
    </Splitter.Panel>
  </Splitter.Root>
)

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Splitter } from '@ark-ui/vue/splitter'
import styles from 'styles/splitter.module.css'
</script>

<template>
  <Splitter.Root :class="styles.Root" :panels="[{ id: 'a' }, { id: 'b' }]">
    <Splitter.Panel :class="styles.Panel" id="a">A</Splitter.Panel>
    <Splitter.ResizeTrigger :class="styles.ResizeTrigger" id="a:b" aria-label="Resize">
      <Splitter.ResizeTriggerIndicator :class="styles.ResizeTriggerIndicator" />
    </Splitter.ResizeTrigger>
    <Splitter.Panel :class="styles.Panel" id="b">B</Splitter.Panel>
  </Splitter.Root>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Splitter } from '@ark-ui/svelte/splitter'
  import styles from 'styles/splitter.module.css'
</script>

<Splitter.Root class={styles.Root} panels={[{ id: 'a' }, { id: 'b' }]}>
  <Splitter.Panel class={styles.Panel} id="a">A</Splitter.Panel>
  <Splitter.ResizeTrigger class={styles.ResizeTrigger} id="a:b" aria-label="Resize">
    <Splitter.ResizeTriggerIndicator class={styles.ResizeTriggerIndicator} />
  </Splitter.ResizeTrigger>
  <Splitter.Panel class={styles.Panel} id="b">B</Splitter.Panel>
</Splitter.Root>

```

### Context

The Splitter component allows you to pass a function as a child to gain direct access to its API. This provides more
control and allows you to modify the size of the panels programmatically:

**Example: context**

#### React

```tsx
import { Splitter } from '@ark-ui/react/splitter'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/splitter.module.css'

export const Context = () => (
  <Splitter.Root className={styles.Root} panels={[{ id: 'a' }, { id: 'b' }]}>
    <Splitter.Context>
      {(splitter) => (
        <>
          <Splitter.Panel className={styles.Panel} id="a">
            <button className={button.Root} type="button" onClick={() => splitter.resizePanel('a', 10)}>
              Set to 10%
            </button>
          </Splitter.Panel>
          <Splitter.ResizeTrigger className={styles.ResizeTrigger} id="a:b" aria-label="Resize">
            <Splitter.ResizeTriggerIndicator className={styles.ResizeTriggerIndicator} />
          </Splitter.ResizeTrigger>
          <Splitter.Panel className={styles.Panel} id="b">
            <button className={button.Root} type="button" onClick={() => splitter.resizePanel('b', 10)}>
              Set to 10%
            </button>
          </Splitter.Panel>
        </>
      )}
    </Splitter.Context>
  </Splitter.Root>
)

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Splitter } from '@ark-ui/solid/splitter'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/splitter.module.css'

export const Context = () => (
  <Splitter.Root class={styles.Root} panels={[{ id: 'a' }, { id: 'b' }]}>
    <Splitter.Context>
      {(splitter) => (
        <>
          <Splitter.Panel class={styles.Panel} id="a">
            <button class={button.Root} type="button" onClick={() => splitter().resizePanel('a', 10)}>
              Set to 10%
            </button>
          </Splitter.Panel>
          <Splitter.ResizeTrigger class={styles.ResizeTrigger} id="a:b" aria-label="Resize">
            <Splitter.ResizeTriggerIndicator class={styles.ResizeTriggerIndicator} />
          </Splitter.ResizeTrigger>
          <Splitter.Panel class={styles.Panel} id="b">
            <button class={button.Root} type="button" onClick={() => splitter().resizePanel('b', 10)}>
              Set to 10%
            </button>
          </Splitter.Panel>
        </>
      )}
    </Splitter.Context>
  </Splitter.Root>
)

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Splitter } from '@ark-ui/vue/splitter'
import styles from 'styles/splitter.module.css'
</script>

<template>
  <Splitter.Root :class="styles.Root" :panels="[{ id: 'a' }, { id: 'b' }]">
    <Splitter.Context v-slot="splitter">
      <Splitter.Panel :class="styles.Panel" id="a">
        <button @click="splitter.resizePanel('a', 10)">Set A to 10%</button>
      </Splitter.Panel>
      <Splitter.ResizeTrigger :class="styles.ResizeTrigger" id="a:b" aria-label="Resize">
        <Splitter.ResizeTriggerIndicator :class="styles.ResizeTriggerIndicator" />
      </Splitter.ResizeTrigger>
      <Splitter.Panel :class="styles.Panel" id="b">
        <button @click="splitter.resizePanel('b', 10)">Set B to 10%</button>
      </Splitter.Panel>
    </Splitter.Context>
  </Splitter.Root>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Splitter } from '@ark-ui/svelte/splitter'
  import styles from 'styles/splitter.module.css'
</script>

<Splitter.Root class={styles.Root} panels={[{ id: 'a' }, { id: 'b' }]}>
  <Splitter.Context>
    {#snippet render(splitter)}
      <Splitter.Panel class={styles.Panel} id="a">
        <button type="button" onclick={() => splitter().resizePanel('a', 10)}>Set to 10%</button>
      </Splitter.Panel>
      <Splitter.ResizeTrigger class={styles.ResizeTrigger} id="a:b" aria-label="Resize">
        <Splitter.ResizeTriggerIndicator class={styles.ResizeTriggerIndicator} />
      </Splitter.ResizeTrigger>
      <Splitter.Panel class={styles.Panel} id="b">
        <button type="button" onclick={() => splitter().resizePanel('b', 10)}>Set to 10%</button>
      </Splitter.Panel>
    {/snippet}
  </Splitter.Context>
</Splitter.Root>

```

### Vertical

By default, the Splitter component is horizontal. If you need a vertical splitter, use the `orientation` prop:

**Example: vertical**

#### React

```tsx
import { Splitter } from '@ark-ui/react/splitter'
import styles from 'styles/splitter.module.css'

export const Vertical = () => (
  <Splitter.Root className={styles.Root} orientation="vertical" panels={[{ id: 'a' }, { id: 'b' }]}>
    <Splitter.Panel className={styles.Panel} id="a">
      A
    </Splitter.Panel>
    <Splitter.ResizeTrigger className={styles.ResizeTrigger} id="a:b" aria-label="Resize">
      <Splitter.ResizeTriggerIndicator className={styles.ResizeTriggerIndicator} />
    </Splitter.ResizeTrigger>
    <Splitter.Panel className={styles.Panel} id="b">
      B
    </Splitter.Panel>
  </Splitter.Root>
)

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Splitter } from '@ark-ui/solid/splitter'
import styles from 'styles/splitter.module.css'

export const Vertical = () => (
  <Splitter.Root class={styles.Root} orientation="vertical" panels={[{ id: 'a' }, { id: 'b' }]}>
    <Splitter.Panel class={styles.Panel} id="a">
      A
    </Splitter.Panel>
    <Splitter.ResizeTrigger class={styles.ResizeTrigger} id="a:b" aria-label="Resize">
      <Splitter.ResizeTriggerIndicator class={styles.ResizeTriggerIndicator} />
    </Splitter.ResizeTrigger>
    <Splitter.Panel class={styles.Panel} id="b">
      B
    </Splitter.Panel>
  </Splitter.Root>
)

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Splitter } from '@ark-ui/vue/splitter'
import styles from 'styles/splitter.module.css'
</script>

<template>
  <Splitter.Root :class="styles.Root" orientation="vertical" :panels="[{ id: 'a' }, { id: 'b' }]">
    <Splitter.Panel :class="styles.Panel" id="a">A</Splitter.Panel>
    <Splitter.ResizeTrigger :class="styles.ResizeTrigger" id="a:b" aria-label="Resize">
      <Splitter.ResizeTriggerIndicator :class="styles.ResizeTriggerIndicator" />
    </Splitter.ResizeTrigger>
    <Splitter.Panel :class="styles.Panel" id="b">B</Splitter.Panel>
  </Splitter.Root>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Splitter } from '@ark-ui/svelte/splitter'
  import styles from 'styles/splitter.module.css'
</script>

<Splitter.Root class={styles.Root} orientation="vertical" panels={[{ id: 'a' }, { id: 'b' }]}>
  <Splitter.Panel class={styles.Panel} id="a">A</Splitter.Panel>
  <Splitter.ResizeTrigger class={styles.ResizeTrigger} id="a:b" aria-label="Resize">
    <Splitter.ResizeTriggerIndicator class={styles.ResizeTriggerIndicator} />
  </Splitter.ResizeTrigger>
  <Splitter.Panel class={styles.Panel} id="b">B</Splitter.Panel>
</Splitter.Root>

```

### Collapsible Panels

To make a panel collapsible, set the `collapsible` prop to `true` on the panel you want to make collapsible.
Additionally, you can use the `collapsedSize` prop to set the size of the panel when it's collapsed.

> This can be useful for building sidebar layouts.

**Example: collapsible**

#### React

```tsx
import { Splitter } from '@ark-ui/react/splitter'
import styles from 'styles/splitter.module.css'

export const Collapsible = () => (
  <Splitter.Root
    className={styles.Root}
    defaultSize={[15, 20]}
    panels={[
      { id: 'a', collapsible: true, collapsedSize: 5, minSize: 10, maxSize: 20 },
      { id: 'b', minSize: 50 },
    ]}
  >
    <Splitter.Panel className={styles.Panel} id="a">
      A
    </Splitter.Panel>
    <Splitter.ResizeTrigger className={styles.ResizeTrigger} id="a:b" aria-label="Resize">
      <Splitter.ResizeTriggerIndicator className={styles.ResizeTriggerIndicator} />
    </Splitter.ResizeTrigger>
    <Splitter.Panel className={styles.Panel} id="b">
      B
    </Splitter.Panel>
  </Splitter.Root>
)

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Splitter } from '@ark-ui/solid/splitter'
import styles from 'styles/splitter.module.css'

export const Collapsible = () => (
  <Splitter.Root
    class={styles.Root}
    defaultSize={[15, 20]}
    panels={[
      { id: 'a', collapsible: true, collapsedSize: 5, minSize: 10, maxSize: 20 },
      { id: 'b', minSize: 50 },
    ]}
  >
    <Splitter.Panel class={styles.Panel} id="a">
      A
    </Splitter.Panel>
    <Splitter.ResizeTrigger class={styles.ResizeTrigger} id="a:b" aria-label="Resize">
      <Splitter.ResizeTriggerIndicator class={styles.ResizeTriggerIndicator} />
    </Splitter.ResizeTrigger>
    <Splitter.Panel class={styles.Panel} id="b">
      B
    </Splitter.Panel>
  </Splitter.Root>
)

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Splitter } from '@ark-ui/vue/splitter'
import styles from 'styles/splitter.module.css'
</script>

<template>
  <Splitter.Root
    :class="styles.Root"
    :default-size="[15, 20]"
    :panels="[
      { id: 'a', collapsible: true, collapsedSize: 5, minSize: 10, maxSize: 20 },
      { id: 'b', minSize: 50 },
    ]"
  >
    <Splitter.Panel :class="styles.Panel" id="a">A</Splitter.Panel>
    <Splitter.ResizeTrigger :class="styles.ResizeTrigger" id="a:b" aria-label="Resize">
      <Splitter.ResizeTriggerIndicator :class="styles.ResizeTriggerIndicator" />
    </Splitter.ResizeTrigger>
    <Splitter.Panel :class="styles.Panel" id="b">B</Splitter.Panel>
  </Splitter.Root>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Splitter } from '@ark-ui/svelte/splitter'
  import styles from 'styles/splitter.module.css'
</script>

<Splitter.Root
  class={styles.Root}
  defaultSize={[15, 20]}
  panels={[
    { id: 'a', collapsible: true, collapsedSize: 5, minSize: 10, maxSize: 20 },
    { id: 'b', minSize: 50 },
  ]}
>
  <Splitter.Panel class={styles.Panel} id="a">A</Splitter.Panel>
  <Splitter.ResizeTrigger class={styles.ResizeTrigger} id="a:b" aria-label="Resize">
    <Splitter.ResizeTriggerIndicator class={styles.ResizeTriggerIndicator} />
  </Splitter.ResizeTrigger>
  <Splitter.Panel class={styles.Panel} id="b">B</Splitter.Panel>
</Splitter.Root>

```

### Multiple Panels

Here's an example of how to use the `Splitter` component with multiple panels.

**Example: multiple-panels**

#### React

```tsx
import { Splitter } from '@ark-ui/react/splitter'
import styles from 'styles/splitter.module.css'

export const MultiplePanels = () => (
  <Splitter.Root
    className={styles.Root}
    panels={[
      { id: 'a', minSize: 20 },
      { id: 'b', minSize: 40 },
      { id: 'c', minSize: 20 },
    ]}
    defaultSize={[20, 60, 20]}
  >
    <Splitter.Panel className={styles.Panel} id="a">
      A
    </Splitter.Panel>
    <Splitter.ResizeTrigger className={styles.ResizeTrigger} id="a:b" aria-label="Resize">
      <Splitter.ResizeTriggerIndicator className={styles.ResizeTriggerIndicator} />
    </Splitter.ResizeTrigger>
    <Splitter.Panel className={styles.Panel} id="b">
      B
    </Splitter.Panel>
    <Splitter.ResizeTrigger className={styles.ResizeTrigger} id="b:c" aria-label="Resize">
      <Splitter.ResizeTriggerIndicator className={styles.ResizeTriggerIndicator} />
    </Splitter.ResizeTrigger>
    <Splitter.Panel className={styles.Panel} id="c">
      C
    </Splitter.Panel>
  </Splitter.Root>
)

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Splitter } from '@ark-ui/solid/splitter'
import styles from 'styles/splitter.module.css'

export const MultiplePanels = () => (
  <Splitter.Root
    class={styles.Root}
    panels={[
      { id: 'a', minSize: 20 },
      { id: 'b', minSize: 40 },
      { id: 'c', minSize: 20 },
    ]}
    defaultSize={[20, 60, 20]}
  >
    <Splitter.Panel class={styles.Panel} id="a">
      A
    </Splitter.Panel>
    <Splitter.ResizeTrigger class={styles.ResizeTrigger} id="a:b" aria-label="Resize">
      <Splitter.ResizeTriggerIndicator class={styles.ResizeTriggerIndicator} />
    </Splitter.ResizeTrigger>
    <Splitter.Panel class={styles.Panel} id="b">
      B
    </Splitter.Panel>
    <Splitter.ResizeTrigger class={styles.ResizeTrigger} id="b:c" aria-label="Resize">
      <Splitter.ResizeTriggerIndicator class={styles.ResizeTriggerIndicator} />
    </Splitter.ResizeTrigger>
    <Splitter.Panel class={styles.Panel} id="c">
      C
    </Splitter.Panel>
  </Splitter.Root>
)

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Splitter } from '@ark-ui/vue/splitter'
import styles from 'styles/splitter.module.css'
</script>

<template>
  <Splitter.Root
    :class="styles.Root"
    :panels="[
      { id: 'a', minSize: 20 },
      { id: 'b', minSize: 40 },
      { id: 'c', minSize: 20 },
    ]"
    :default-size="[20, 60, 20]"
  >
    <Splitter.Panel :class="styles.Panel" id="a">A</Splitter.Panel>
    <Splitter.ResizeTrigger :class="styles.ResizeTrigger" id="a:b" aria-label="Resize">
      <Splitter.ResizeTriggerIndicator :class="styles.ResizeTriggerIndicator" />
    </Splitter.ResizeTrigger>
    <Splitter.Panel :class="styles.Panel" id="b">B</Splitter.Panel>
    <Splitter.ResizeTrigger :class="styles.ResizeTrigger" id="b:c" aria-label="Resize">
      <Splitter.ResizeTriggerIndicator :class="styles.ResizeTriggerIndicator" />
    </Splitter.ResizeTrigger>
    <Splitter.Panel :class="styles.Panel" id="c">C</Splitter.Panel>
  </Splitter.Root>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Splitter } from '@ark-ui/svelte/splitter'
  import styles from 'styles/splitter.module.css'
</script>

<Splitter.Root
  class={styles.Root}
  panels={[
    { id: 'a', minSize: 20 },
    { id: 'b', minSize: 40 },
    { id: 'c', minSize: 20 },
  ]}
  defaultSize={[20, 60, 20]}
>
  <Splitter.Panel class={styles.Panel} id="a">A</Splitter.Panel>
  <Splitter.ResizeTrigger class={styles.ResizeTrigger} id="a:b" aria-label="Resize">
    <Splitter.ResizeTriggerIndicator class={styles.ResizeTriggerIndicator} />
  </Splitter.ResizeTrigger>
  <Splitter.Panel class={styles.Panel} id="b">B</Splitter.Panel>
  <Splitter.ResizeTrigger class={styles.ResizeTrigger} id="b:c" aria-label="Resize">
    <Splitter.ResizeTriggerIndicator class={styles.ResizeTriggerIndicator} />
  </Splitter.ResizeTrigger>
  <Splitter.Panel class={styles.Panel} id="c">C</Splitter.Panel>
</Splitter.Root>

```

### Root Provider

An alternative way to control the splitter is to use the `RootProvider` component and the `useSplitter` hook. This way
you can access the state and methods from outside the component.

**Example: root-provider**

#### React

```tsx
import { Splitter, useSplitter } from '@ark-ui/react/splitter'
import styles from 'styles/splitter.module.css'

export const RootProvider = () => {
  const splitter = useSplitter({
    defaultSize: [50, 50],
    panels: [{ id: 'a' }, { id: 'b' }],
  })

  return (
    <div className="stack">
      <output>current size: {JSON.stringify(splitter.getSizes())}</output>

      <Splitter.RootProvider className={styles.Root} value={splitter}>
        <Splitter.Panel className={styles.Panel} id="a">
          A
        </Splitter.Panel>
        <Splitter.ResizeTrigger className={styles.ResizeTrigger} id="a:b" aria-label="Resize">
          <Splitter.ResizeTriggerIndicator className={styles.ResizeTriggerIndicator} />
        </Splitter.ResizeTrigger>
        <Splitter.Panel className={styles.Panel} id="b">
          B
        </Splitter.Panel>
      </Splitter.RootProvider>
    </div>
  )
}

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Splitter, useSplitter } from '@ark-ui/solid/splitter'
import styles from 'styles/splitter.module.css'

export const RootProvider = () => {
  const splitter = useSplitter({
    defaultSize: [50, 50],
    panels: [{ id: 'a' }, { id: 'b' }],
  })

  return (
    <div class="stack">
      <output>current size: {JSON.stringify(splitter().getSizes())}</output>

      <Splitter.RootProvider class={styles.Root} value={splitter}>
        <Splitter.Panel class={styles.Panel} id="a">
          A
        </Splitter.Panel>
        <Splitter.ResizeTrigger class={styles.ResizeTrigger} id="a:b" aria-label="Resize">
          <Splitter.ResizeTriggerIndicator class={styles.ResizeTriggerIndicator} />
        </Splitter.ResizeTrigger>
        <Splitter.Panel class={styles.Panel} id="b">
          B
        </Splitter.Panel>
      </Splitter.RootProvider>
    </div>
  )
}

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Splitter, useSplitter } from '@ark-ui/vue/splitter'
import styles from 'styles/splitter.module.css'

const splitter = useSplitter({
  defaultSize: [50, 50],
  panels: [{ id: 'a' }, { id: 'b' }],
})
</script>

<template>
  <div class="stack">
    <output>current size: {{ JSON.stringify(splitter.getSizes()) }}</output>

    <Splitter.RootProvider :class="styles.Root" :value="splitter">
      <Splitter.Panel :class="styles.Panel" id="a">A</Splitter.Panel>
      <Splitter.ResizeTrigger :class="styles.ResizeTrigger" id="a:b" aria-label="Resize">
        <Splitter.ResizeTriggerIndicator :class="styles.ResizeTriggerIndicator" />
      </Splitter.ResizeTrigger>
      <Splitter.Panel :class="styles.Panel" id="b">B</Splitter.Panel>
    </Splitter.RootProvider>
  </div>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Splitter, useSplitter } from '@ark-ui/svelte/splitter'
  import styles from 'styles/splitter.module.css'

  const id = $props.id()
  const splitter = useSplitter({
    id,
    defaultSize: [50, 50],
    panels: [{ id: 'a' }, { id: 'b' }],
  })
</script>

<div class="stack">
  <output>current size: {JSON.stringify(splitter().getSizes())}</output>

  <Splitter.RootProvider class={styles.Root} value={splitter}>
    <Splitter.Panel class={styles.Panel} id="a">A</Splitter.Panel>
    <Splitter.ResizeTrigger class={styles.ResizeTrigger} id="a:b" aria-label="Resize">
      <Splitter.ResizeTriggerIndicator class={styles.ResizeTriggerIndicator} />
    </Splitter.ResizeTrigger>
    <Splitter.Panel class={styles.Panel} id="b">B</Splitter.Panel>
  </Splitter.RootProvider>
</div>

```

### Resize Indicator

Use the `Splitter.ResizeTriggerIndicator` component to show a visual indicator on the resize handle.

**Example: resize-indicator**

#### React

```tsx
import { Splitter } from '@ark-ui/react/splitter'
import styles from 'styles/splitter.module.css'

export const ResizeIndicator = () => (
  <Splitter.Root className={styles.Root} panels={[{ id: 'a' }, { id: 'b' }]}>
    <Splitter.Panel className={styles.Panel} id="a">
      A
    </Splitter.Panel>
    <Splitter.ResizeTrigger className={styles.ResizeTrigger} id="a:b" aria-label="Resize">
      <Splitter.ResizeTriggerIndicator className={styles.ResizeTriggerIndicator} />
    </Splitter.ResizeTrigger>
    <Splitter.Panel className={styles.Panel} id="b">
      B
    </Splitter.Panel>
  </Splitter.Root>
)

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Splitter } from '@ark-ui/solid/splitter'
import styles from 'styles/splitter.module.css'

export const ResizeIndicator = () => (
  <Splitter.Root class={styles.Root} panels={[{ id: 'a' }, { id: 'b' }]}>
    <Splitter.Panel class={styles.Panel} id="a">
      A
    </Splitter.Panel>
    <Splitter.ResizeTrigger class={styles.ResizeTrigger} id="a:b" aria-label="Resize">
      <Splitter.ResizeTriggerIndicator class={styles.ResizeTriggerIndicator} />
    </Splitter.ResizeTrigger>
    <Splitter.Panel class={styles.Panel} id="b">
      B
    </Splitter.Panel>
  </Splitter.Root>
)

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Splitter } from '@ark-ui/vue/splitter'
import styles from 'styles/splitter.module.css'
</script>

<template>
  <Splitter.Root :class="styles.Root" :panels="[{ id: 'a' }, { id: 'b' }]">
    <Splitter.Panel :class="styles.Panel" id="a">A</Splitter.Panel>
    <Splitter.ResizeTrigger :class="styles.ResizeTrigger" id="a:b" aria-label="Resize">
      <Splitter.ResizeTriggerIndicator :class="styles.ResizeTriggerIndicator" />
    </Splitter.ResizeTrigger>
    <Splitter.Panel :class="styles.Panel" id="b">B</Splitter.Panel>
  </Splitter.Root>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Splitter } from '@ark-ui/svelte/splitter'
  import styles from 'styles/splitter.module.css'
</script>

<Splitter.Root class={styles.Root} panels={[{ id: 'a' }, { id: 'b' }]}>
  <Splitter.Panel class={styles.Panel} id="a">A</Splitter.Panel>
  <Splitter.ResizeTrigger class={styles.ResizeTrigger} id="a:b" aria-label="Resize">
    <Splitter.ResizeTriggerIndicator class={styles.ResizeTriggerIndicator} />
  </Splitter.ResizeTrigger>
  <Splitter.Panel class={styles.Panel} id="b">B</Splitter.Panel>
</Splitter.Root>

```

### Dynamic Collapsible

Use the `collapsePanel()` and `expandPanel()` methods to programmatically control panel collapse based on viewport size.
This is useful for responsive sidebar layouts that collapse on smaller screens.

**Example: dynamic-collapsible**

#### React

```tsx
/** biome-ignore-all lint/correctness/useExhaustiveDependencies: intentional */

import { Splitter, useSplitter } from '@ark-ui/react/splitter'
import { useLayoutEffect, useRef, useState } from 'react'
import styles from 'styles/splitter.module.css'

export const DynamicCollapsible = () => {
  const [rootSize, setRootSize] = useState<number | null>(null)
  const ref = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null)

  useLayoutEffect(() => {
    const handleResize = () => setRootSize(ref.current?.offsetWidth ?? null)
    handleResize()
    window.addEventListener('resize', handleResize)
    return () => window.removeEventListener('resize', handleResize)
  }, [])

  const isBelowMd = rootSize != null && rootSize < 600

  useLayoutEffect(() => {
    if (isBelowMd) splitter.collapsePanel('a')
    else splitter.expandPanel('a')
  }, [isBelowMd])

  const splitter = useSplitter({
    panels: [{ id: 'a', collapsible: isBelowMd, collapsedSize: 5, minSize: 20, maxSize: 40 }, { id: 'b' }],
    defaultSize: [15, 85],
  })

  return (
    <Splitter.RootProvider className={styles.Root} value={splitter} ref={ref}>
      <Splitter.Panel className={styles.Panel} id="a">
        A
      </Splitter.Panel>
      <Splitter.ResizeTrigger className={styles.ResizeTrigger} id="a:b" aria-label="Resize panels">
        <Splitter.ResizeTriggerIndicator className={styles.ResizeTriggerIndicator} />
      </Splitter.ResizeTrigger>
      <Splitter.Panel className={styles.Panel} id="b">
        B
      </Splitter.Panel>
    </Splitter.RootProvider>
  )
}

```

# Steps



## Anatomy



```tsx
<Steps.Root>
  <Steps.List>
    <Steps.Item>
      <Steps.Trigger>
        <Steps.Indicator />
      </Steps.Trigger>

  <Steps.CompletedContent />
  <Steps.PrevTrigger />
  <Steps.NextTrigger />
</Steps.Root>
```

## Examples

### Basic

Here's a basic example of the `Steps` component.

```tsx
import { Steps } from '@ark-ui/react/steps'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/steps.module.css'

const items = [
  { value: 'first', title: 'First', description: 'Contact Info' },
  { value: 'second', title: 'Second', description: 'Date & Time' },
  { value: 'third', title: 'Third', description: 'Select Rooms' },
]

export const Basic = () => {
  return (
    <Steps.Root className={styles.Root} count={items.length}>
      <Steps.List className={styles.List}>
        {items.map((item, index) => (
          <Steps.Item className={styles.Item} key={index} index={index}>
            <Steps.Trigger className={styles.Trigger}>
              <Steps.Indicator className={styles.Indicator}>{index + 1}</Steps.Indicator>
              <span>{item.title}</span>
            </Steps.Trigger>
            <Steps.Separator className={styles.Separator} />
          </Steps.Item>
        ))}
      </Steps.List>

      {items.map((item, index) => (
        <Steps.Content className={styles.Content} key={index} index={index}>
          {item.title} - {item.description}
        </Steps.Content>
      ))}

      <Steps.CompletedContent className={styles.CompletedContent}>
        Steps Complete - Thank you for filling out the form!
      </Steps.CompletedContent>

      <div className={styles.Actions}>
        <Steps.PrevTrigger className={button.Root}>Back</Steps.PrevTrigger>
        <Steps.NextTrigger className={button.Root} data-variant="solid">
          Next
        </Steps.NextTrigger>
      </div>
    </Steps.Root>
  )
}
```

### Controlled

Using the `RootProvider` component, you can control the active step by using the `step` prop and handling the
`onStepChange` event.

**Example: controlled**

#### React

```tsx
import { Steps } from '@ark-ui/react/steps'
import { useState } from 'react'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/steps.module.css'

const items = [
  { value: 'first', title: 'First', description: 'Contact Info' },
  { value: 'second', title: 'Second', description: 'Date & Time' },
  { value: 'third', title: 'Third', description: 'Select Rooms' },
]

export const Controlled = () => {
  const [step, setStep] = useState(0)

  return (
    <div className="stack">
      <output>current step: {step + 1}</output>

      <Steps.Root
        className={styles.Root}
        count={items.length}
        step={step}
        onStepChange={(details) => setStep(details.step)}
      >
        <Steps.List className={styles.List}>
          {items.map((item, index) => (
            <Steps.Item className={styles.Item} key={index} index={index}>
              <Steps.Trigger className={styles.Trigger}>
                <Steps.Indicator className={styles.Indicator}>{index + 1}</Steps.Indicator>
                <span>{item.title}</span>
              </Steps.Trigger>
              <Steps.Separator className={styles.Separator} />
            </Steps.Item>
          ))}
        </Steps.List>

        {items.map((item, index) => (
          <Steps.Content className={styles.Content} key={index} index={index}>
            {item.title} - {item.description}
          </Steps.Content>
        ))}

        <Steps.CompletedContent className={styles.CompletedContent}>

### Root Provider

An alternative way to control the steps is to use the `RootProvider` component and the `useSteps` hook. This way you can
access the state and methods from outside the component.

**Example: root-provider**

#### React

```tsx
import { Steps, useSteps } from '@ark-ui/react/steps'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/steps.module.css'

const items = [
  { value: 'first', title: 'First', description: 'Contact Info' },
  { value: 'second', title: 'Second', description: 'Date & Time' },
  { value: 'third', title: 'Third', description: 'Select Rooms' },
]

export const RootProvider = () => {
  const steps = useSteps({ count: items.length })

  return (
    <div className="stack">
      <output>current step: {steps.value + 1}</output>

      <Steps.RootProvider className={styles.Root} value={steps}>
        <Steps.List className={styles.List}>
          {items.map((item, index) => (
            <Steps.Item className={styles.Item} key={index} index={index}>
              <Steps.Trigger className={styles.Trigger}>
                <Steps.Indicator className={styles.Indicator}>{index + 1}</Steps.Indicator>
                <span>{item.title}</span>
              </Steps.Trigger>
              <Steps.Separator className={styles.Separator} />
            </Steps.Item>
          ))}
        </Steps.List>

        {items.map((item, index) => (
          <Steps.Content className={styles.Content} key={index} index={index}>
            {item.title} - {item.description}
          </Steps.Content>
        ))}

        <Steps.CompletedContent className={styles.CompletedContent}>
          Steps Complete - Thank you for filling out the form!
        </Steps.CompletedContent>

        <div className={styles.Actions}>
          <Steps.PrevTrigger className={button.Root}>Back</Steps.PrevTrigger>
          <Steps.NextTrigger className={button.Root} data-variant="solid">
            Next
          </Steps.NextTrigger>
        </div>
      </Steps.RootProvider>
    </div>
  )
}

```

#### Solid

export const RootProvider = () => {

### Vertical

Use the `orientation` prop to display the steps vertically.

**Example: vertical**

#### React

```tsx
import { Steps } from '@ark-ui/react/steps'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/steps.module.css'

  { value: 'first', title: 'First', description: 'Contact Info' },
  { value: 'second', title: 'Second', description: 'Date & Time' },
  { value: 'third', title: 'Third', description: 'Select Rooms' },
]

export const Vertical = () => {
  return (
    <Steps.Root className={styles.Root} count={items.length} orientation="vertical">
      <Steps.List className={styles.List}>
        {items.map((item, index) => (
          <Steps.Item className={styles.Item} key={index} index={index}>
            <Steps.Trigger className={styles.Trigger}>
              <Steps.Indicator className={styles.Indicator}>{index + 1}</Steps.Indicator>
              <span>{item.title}</span>
            </Steps.Trigger>
            <Steps.Separator className={styles.Separator} />
          </Steps.Item>
        ))}
      </Steps.List>

      {items.map((item, index) => (
        <Steps.Content className={styles.Content} key={index} index={index}>
          <div className="vstack">
            <span>
              {item.title} - {item.description}

            <div className={styles.Actions}>
              <Steps.PrevTrigger className={button.Root}>Back</Steps.PrevTrigger>
              <Steps.NextTrigger className={button.Root} data-variant="solid">
                Next
              </Steps.NextTrigger>
            </div>
          </div>
        </Steps.Content>
      ))}

      <Steps.CompletedContent className={styles.CompletedContent}>
        <div className="vstack">

    </Switch.Control>
    <Switch.Label :class="styles.Label">Label</Switch.Label>
    <Switch.HiddenInput />
  </Switch.Root>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Switch } from '@ark-ui/svelte/switch'
  import styles from 'styles/switch.module.css'
</script>

<Switch.Root class={styles.Root}>
  <Switch.Control class={styles.Control}>
    <Switch.Thumb class={styles.Thumb} />
  </Switch.Control>
  <Switch.Label class={styles.Label}>Label</Switch.Label>
  <Switch.HiddenInput />
</Switch.Root>

```

### Controlled

For a controlled Switch component, the state of the toggle is managed using the checked prop, and updates when the
`onCheckedChange` event handler is called:

**Example: controlled**

#### React

```tsx
import { Switch } from '@ark-ui/react/switch'
import { useState } from 'react'
import styles from 'styles/switch.module.css'

export const Controlled = () => {
  const [checked, setChecked] = useState(false)

  return (
    <Switch.Root className={styles.Root} checked={checked} onCheckedChange={(e) => setChecked(e.checked)}>
      <Switch.Control className={styles.Control}>
        <Switch.Thumb className={styles.Thumb} />
      </Switch.Control>
      <Switch.Label className={styles.Label}>Label</Switch.Label>
      <Switch.HiddenInput />
    </Switch.Root>
  )
}

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Switch } from '@ark-ui/solid/switch'
import { createSignal } from 'solid-js'
import styles from 'styles/switch.module.css'

export const Controlled = () => {
  const [checked, setChecked] = createSignal(false)

  return (
    <Switch.Root class={styles.Root} checked={checked()} onCheckedChange={(e) => setChecked(e.checked)}>
      <Switch.Control class={styles.Control}>
        <Switch.Thumb class={styles.Thumb} />
      </Switch.Control>
      <Switch.Label class={styles.Label}>Label</Switch.Label>
      <Switch.HiddenInput />
    </Switch.Root>
  )
}

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Switch } from '@ark-ui/vue/switch'
import { ref } from 'vue'
import styles from 'styles/switch.module.css'

const checked = ref(false)
</script>

<template>
  <Switch.Root :class="styles.Root" v-model:checked="checked">
    <Switch.Control :class="styles.Control">
      <Switch.Thumb :class="styles.Thumb" />
    </Switch.Control>
    <Switch.Label :class="styles.Label">Label</Switch.Label>
    <Switch.HiddenInput />
  </Switch.Root>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Switch } from '@ark-ui/svelte/switch'
  import styles from 'styles/switch.module.css'

  let checked = $state(false)
</script>

<Switch.Root class={styles.Root} bind:checked>
  <Switch.Control class={styles.Control}>
    <Switch.Thumb class={styles.Thumb} />
  </Switch.Control>
  <Switch.Label class={styles.Label}>Label</Switch.Label>
  <Switch.HiddenInput />
</Switch.Root>

```

### Root Provider

An alternative way to control the switch is to use the `RootProvider` component and the `useSwitch` hook. This way you
can access the state and methods from outside the component.

**Example: root-provider**

#### React

```tsx
import { Switch, useSwitch } from '@ark-ui/react/switch'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/switch.module.css'

export const RootProvider = () => {
  const _switch = useSwitch()

  return (
    <div className="stack">
      <button className={button.Root} onClick={() => _switch.toggleChecked()}>
        Toggle
      </button>

      <Switch.RootProvider className={styles.Root} value={_switch}>
        <Switch.Control className={styles.Control}>
          <Switch.Thumb className={styles.Thumb} />
        </Switch.Control>
        <Switch.Label className={styles.Label}>Label</Switch.Label>
        <Switch.HiddenInput />
      </Switch.RootProvider>
    </div>
  )
}

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Switch, useSwitch } from '@ark-ui/solid/switch'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/switch.module.css'

export const RootProvider = () => {
  const _switch = useSwitch()

  return (
    <div class="stack">
      <button class={button.Root} onClick={() => _switch().toggleChecked()}>
        Toggle
      </button>

      <Switch.RootProvider class={styles.Root} value={_switch}>
        <Switch.Control class={styles.Control}>
          <Switch.Thumb class={styles.Thumb} />
        </Switch.Control>
        <Switch.Label class={styles.Label}>Label</Switch.Label>
        <Switch.HiddenInput />
      </Switch.RootProvider>
    </div>
  )
}

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Switch, useSwitch } from '@ark-ui/vue/switch'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/switch.module.css'

const _switch = useSwitch()
</script>

<template>
  <div class="stack">
    <button :class="button.Root" @click="_switch.toggleChecked()">Toggle</button>

    <Switch.RootProvider :class="styles.Root" :value="_switch">
      <Switch.Control :class="styles.Control">
        <Switch.Thumb :class="styles.Thumb" />
      </Switch.Control>
      <Switch.Label :class="styles.Label">Label</Switch.Label>
      <Switch.HiddenInput />
    </Switch.RootProvider>
  </div>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Switch, useSwitch } from '@ark-ui/svelte/switch'
  import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
  import styles from 'styles/switch.module.css'

  const id = $props.id()
  const _switch = useSwitch({ id })
</script>

<div class="stack">
  <button class={button.Root} onclick={() => _switch().toggleChecked()}>Toggle</button>

  <Switch.RootProvider class={styles.Root} value={_switch}>
    <Switch.Control class={styles.Control}>
      <Switch.Thumb class={styles.Thumb} />
    </Switch.Control>
    <Switch.Label class={styles.Label}>Label</Switch.Label>
    <Switch.HiddenInput />
  </Switch.RootProvider>
</div>

```

### Field

The `Field` component helps manage form-related state and accessibility attributes of a switch. It includes handling
ARIA labels, helper text, and error text to ensure proper accessibility.

**Example: with-field**

#### React

```tsx
import { Field } from '@ark-ui/react/field'
import { Switch } from '@ark-ui/react/switch'
import field from 'styles/field.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/switch.module.css'

export const WithField = () => (
  <Field.Root className={field.Root}>
    <Switch.Root className={styles.Root}>
      <Switch.Control className={styles.Control}>
        <Switch.Thumb className={styles.Thumb} />
      </Switch.Control>
      <Switch.Label className={styles.Label}>Label</Switch.Label>
      <Switch.HiddenInput />
    </Switch.Root>
    <Field.HelperText className={field.HelperText}>Additional Info</Field.HelperText>
    <Field.ErrorText className={field.ErrorText}>Error Info</Field.ErrorText>
  </Field.Root>
)

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Field } from '@ark-ui/solid/field'
import { Switch } from '@ark-ui/solid/switch'
import field from 'styles/field.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/switch.module.css'

export const WithField = () => (
  <Field.Root class={field.Root}>
    <Switch.Root class={styles.Root}>
      <Switch.Control class={styles.Control}>
        <Switch.Thumb class={styles.Thumb} />
      </Switch.Control>
      <Switch.Label class={styles.Label}>Label</Switch.Label>
      <Switch.HiddenInput />
    </Switch.Root>
    <Field.HelperText class={field.HelperText}>Additional Info</Field.HelperText>
    <Field.ErrorText class={field.ErrorText}>Error Info</Field.ErrorText>
  </Field.Root>
)

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Field } from '@ark-ui/vue/field'
import { Switch } from '@ark-ui/vue/switch'
import field from 'styles/field.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/switch.module.css'
</script>

<template>
  <Field.Root :class="field.Root">
    <Switch.Root :class="styles.Root">
      <Switch.Control :class="styles.Control">
        <Switch.Thumb :class="styles.Thumb" />
      </Switch.Control>
      <Switch.Label :class="styles.Label">Label</Switch.Label>
      <Switch.HiddenInput />
    </Switch.Root>
    <Field.HelperText :class="field.HelperText">Additional Info</Field.HelperText>
    <Field.ErrorText :class="field.ErrorText">Error Info</Field.ErrorText>
  </Field.Root>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Field } from '@ark-ui/svelte/field'
  import { Switch } from '@ark-ui/svelte/switch'
  import field from 'styles/field.module.css'
  import styles from 'styles/switch.module.css'
</script>

<Field.Root class={field.Root}>
  <Switch.Root class={styles.Root}>
    <Switch.Control class={styles.Control}>
      <Switch.Thumb class={styles.Thumb} />
    </Switch.Control>
    <Switch.Label class={styles.Label}>Label</Switch.Label>
    <Switch.HiddenInput />
  </Switch.Root>
  <Field.HelperText class={field.HelperText}>Additional Info</Field.HelperText>
  <Field.ErrorText class={field.ErrorText}>Error Info</Field.ErrorText>
</Field.Root>

```

### Context

The Switch component allows access to its internal state through the `Context` component. This enables you to
dynamically adjust and customize aspects of the component based on its current state:

**Example: context**

#### React

```tsx
import { Switch } from '@ark-ui/react/switch'
import styles from 'styles/switch.module.css'

export const Context = () => (
  <Switch.Root className={styles.Root}>
    <Switch.Control className={styles.Control}>
      <Switch.Thumb className={styles.Thumb} />
    </Switch.Control>
    <Switch.Context>
      {(context) => (
        <Switch.Label className={styles.Label}>Feature is {context.checked ? 'enabled' : 'disabled'}</Switch.Label>
      )}
    </Switch.Context>
    <Switch.HiddenInput />
  </Switch.Root>
)

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Switch } from '@ark-ui/solid/switch'
import styles from 'styles/switch.module.css'

export const Context = () => (
  <Switch.Root class={styles.Root}>
    <Switch.Control class={styles.Control}>
      <Switch.Thumb class={styles.Thumb} />
    </Switch.Control>
    <Switch.Context>
      {(context) => (
        <Switch.Label class={styles.Label}>Feature is {context().checked ? 'enabled' : 'disabled'}</Switch.Label>
      )}
    </Switch.Context>
    <Switch.HiddenInput />
  </Switch.Root>
)

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Switch } from '@ark-ui/vue/switch'
import styles from 'styles/switch.module.css'
</script>

<template>
  <Switch.Root :class="styles.Root">
    <Switch.Control :class="styles.Control">
      <Switch.Thumb :class="styles.Thumb" />
    </Switch.Control>
    <Switch.Context v-slot="api">
      <Switch.Label :class="styles.Label">Feature is {{ api.checked ? 'enabled' : 'disabled' }}</Switch.Label>
    </Switch.Context>
    <Switch.HiddenInput />
  </Switch.Root>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Switch } from '@ark-ui/svelte/switch'
  import styles from 'styles/switch.module.css'
</script>

<Switch.Root class={styles.Root}>
  <Switch.Control class={styles.Control}>
    <Switch.Thumb class={styles.Thumb} />
  </Switch.Control>
  <Switch.Context>
    {#snippet render(context)}
      <Switch.Label class={styles.Label}>Feature is {context().checked ? 'enabled' : 'disabled'}</Switch.Label>
    {/snippet}
  </Switch.Context>
  <Switch.HiddenInput />
</Switch.Root>

```

## Guides

### asChild

The `Switch.Root` element of the switch is a `label` element. This is because the switch is a form control and should be
associated with a label to provide context and meaning to the user. Otherwise, the HTML and accessibility structure will
be invalid.

> If you need to use the `asChild` property, make sure that the `label` element is the direct child of the `Switch.Root`
> component.

```

### Controlled

To create a controlled Tabs component, manage the current selected tab using the `value` prop and update it when the
`onValueChange` event handler is called:

**Example: controlled**

#### React

```tsx
import { Tabs } from '@ark-ui/react/tabs'
import { useState } from 'react'
import styles from 'styles/tabs.module.css'

export const Controlled = () => {
  const [value, setValue] = useState<string | null>('account')
  return (
    <Tabs.Root className={styles.Root} value={value} onValueChange={(e) => setValue(e.value)}>
      <Tabs.List className={styles.List}>
        <Tabs.Trigger className={styles.Trigger} value="account">
          Account
        </Tabs.Trigger>
        <Tabs.Trigger className={styles.Trigger} value="password">
          Password
        </Tabs.Trigger>
        <Tabs.Trigger className={styles.Trigger} value="billing">
          Billing
        </Tabs.Trigger>
      </Tabs.List>
      <Tabs.Content className={styles.Content} value="account">
        Make changes to your account here.
      </Tabs.Content>
      <Tabs.Content className={styles.Content} value="password">
        Change your password here.
      </Tabs.Content>
      <Tabs.Content className={styles.Content} value="billing">
        Manage your billing and payment details.
      </Tabs.Content>
    </Tabs.Root>
  )
}

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Tabs } from '@ark-ui/solid/tabs'
import { createSignal } from 'solid-js'
import styles from 'styles/tabs.module.css'

export const Controlled = () => {
  const [value, setValue] = createSignal<string | null>('account')
  return (
    <Tabs.Root class={styles.Root} value={value()} onValueChange={(e) => setValue(e.value)}>
      <Tabs.List class={styles.List}>
        <Tabs.Trigger class={styles.Trigger} value="account">
          Account
        </Tabs.Trigger>
        <Tabs.Trigger class={styles.Trigger} value="password">
          Password
        </Tabs.Trigger>
        <Tabs.Trigger class={styles.Trigger} value="billing">
          Billing
        </Tabs.Trigger>
      </Tabs.List>
      <Tabs.Content class={styles.Content} value="account">
        Make changes to your account here.
      </Tabs.Content>
      <Tabs.Content class={styles.Content} value="password">
        Change your password here.
      </Tabs.Content>
      <Tabs.Content class={styles.Content} value="billing">
        Manage your billing and payment details.
      </Tabs.Content>
    </Tabs.Root>
  )
}

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Tabs } from '@ark-ui/vue/tabs'
import { ref } from 'vue'
import styles from 'styles/tabs.module.css'

const value = ref('account')
</script>

<template>
  <Tabs.Root :class="styles.Root" v-model="value">
    <Tabs.List :class="styles.List">
      <Tabs.Trigger :class="styles.Trigger" value="account">Account</Tabs.Trigger>
      <Tabs.Trigger :class="styles.Trigger" value="password">Password</Tabs.Trigger>
      <Tabs.Trigger :class="styles.Trigger" value="billing">Billing</Tabs.Trigger>
    </Tabs.List>
    <Tabs.Content :class="styles.Content" value="account">Make changes to your account here.</Tabs.Content>
    <Tabs.Content :class="styles.Content" value="password">Change your password here.</Tabs.Content>
    <Tabs.Content :class="styles.Content" value="billing">Manage your billing and payment details.</Tabs.Content>
  </Tabs.Root>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Tabs } from '@ark-ui/svelte/tabs'
  import styles from 'styles/tabs.module.css'

  let value = $state<string | null>('account')
</script>

<Tabs.Root class={styles.Root} bind:value>
  <Tabs.List class={styles.List}>
    <Tabs.Trigger class={styles.Trigger} value="account">Account</Tabs.Trigger>
    <Tabs.Trigger class={styles.Trigger} value="password">Password</Tabs.Trigger>
    <Tabs.Trigger class={styles.Trigger} value="billing">Billing</Tabs.Trigger>
  </Tabs.List>
  <Tabs.Content class={styles.Content} value="account">Make changes to your account here.</Tabs.Content>
  <Tabs.Content class={styles.Content} value="password">Change your password here.</Tabs.Content>
  <Tabs.Content class={styles.Content} value="billing">Manage your billing and payment details.</Tabs.Content>
</Tabs.Root>

```

### Root Provider

An alternative way to control the tabs is to use the `RootProvider` component and the `useTabs` hook. This way you can
access the state and methods from outside the component.

**Example: root-provider**

#### React

```tsx
import { Tabs, useTabs } from '@ark-ui/react/tabs'
import styles from 'styles/tabs.module.css'

export const RootProvider = () => {
  const tabs = useTabs({ defaultValue: 'account' })

  return (
    <div className="stack">
      <output>selected: {tabs.value}</output>
      <Tabs.RootProvider className={styles.Root} value={tabs}>
        <Tabs.List className={styles.List}>
          <Tabs.Trigger className={styles.Trigger} value="account">
            Account
          </Tabs.Trigger>
          <Tabs.Trigger className={styles.Trigger} value="password">
            Password
          </Tabs.Trigger>
          <Tabs.Trigger className={styles.Trigger} value="billing">
            Billing
          </Tabs.Trigger>
        </Tabs.List>
        <Tabs.Content className={styles.Content} value="account">
          Make changes to your account here.
        </Tabs.Content>
        <Tabs.Content className={styles.Content} value="password">
          Change your password here.
        </Tabs.Content>
        <Tabs.Content className={styles.Content} value="billing">
          Manage your billing and payment details.
        </Tabs.Content>
      </Tabs.RootProvider>
    </div>
  )
}

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Tabs, useTabs } from '@ark-ui/solid/tabs'
import styles from 'styles/tabs.module.css'

export const RootProvider = () => {
  const tabs = useTabs({ defaultValue: 'account' })

  return (
    <div class="stack">
      <output>selected: {tabs().value}</output>
      <Tabs.RootProvider class={styles.Root} value={tabs}>
        <Tabs.List class={styles.List}>
          <Tabs.Trigger class={styles.Trigger} value="account">
            Account
          </Tabs.Trigger>
          <Tabs.Trigger class={styles.Trigger} value="password">
            Password
          </Tabs.Trigger>
          <Tabs.Trigger class={styles.Trigger} value="billing">
            Billing
          </Tabs.Trigger>
        </Tabs.List>
        <Tabs.Content class={styles.Content} value="account">
          Make changes to your account here.
        </Tabs.Content>
        <Tabs.Content class={styles.Content} value="password">
          Change your password here.
        </Tabs.Content>
        <Tabs.Content class={styles.Content} value="billing">
          Manage your billing and payment details.
        </Tabs.Content>
      </Tabs.RootProvider>
    </div>
  )
}

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Tabs, useTabs } from '@ark-ui/vue/tabs'
import styles from 'styles/tabs.module.css'

const tabs = useTabs({ defaultValue: 'account' })
</script>

<template>
  <div class="stack">
    <output>selected: {{ tabs.value }}</output>
    <Tabs.RootProvider :class="styles.Root" :value="tabs">
      <Tabs.List :class="styles.List">
        <Tabs.Trigger :class="styles.Trigger" value="account">Account</Tabs.Trigger>
        <Tabs.Trigger :class="styles.Trigger" value="password">Password</Tabs.Trigger>
        <Tabs.Trigger :class="styles.Trigger" value="billing">Billing</Tabs.Trigger>
      </Tabs.List>
      <Tabs.Content :class="styles.Content" value="account">Make changes to your account here.</Tabs.Content>
      <Tabs.Content :class="styles.Content" value="password">Change your password here.</Tabs.Content>
      <Tabs.Content :class="styles.Content" value="billing">Manage your billing and payment details.</Tabs.Content>
    </Tabs.RootProvider>
  </div>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Tabs, useTabs } from '@ark-ui/svelte/tabs'
  import styles from 'styles/tabs.module.css'

  const id = $props.id()

  const tabs = useTabs({ id, defaultValue: 'account' })
</script>

<div class="stack">
  <output>selected: {tabs().value}</output>
  <Tabs.RootProvider class={styles.Root} value={tabs}>
    <Tabs.List class={styles.List}>

    <Tabs.Content class={styles.Content} value="billing">Manage your billing and payment details.</Tabs.Content>
  </Tabs.RootProvider>
</div>

```

### Indicator

To provide a visual cue for the selected tab, use the `Tabs.Indicator` component:

**Example: indicator**

#### React

```tsx
import { Tabs } from '@ark-ui/react/tabs'
import styles from 'styles/tabs.module.css'

export const Indicator = () => (
  <Tabs.Root className={styles.Root} defaultValue="account">
    <Tabs.List className={styles.List}>
      <Tabs.Trigger className={styles.TriggerIndicator} value="account">
        Account
      </Tabs.Trigger>
      <Tabs.Trigger className={styles.TriggerIndicator} value="password">
        Password
      </Tabs.Trigger>
      <Tabs.Trigger className={styles.TriggerIndicator} value="billing">
        Billing
      </Tabs.Trigger>
      <Tabs.Indicator className={styles.Indicator} />
    </Tabs.List>
    <Tabs.Content className={styles.Content} value="account">
      Make changes to your account here.
    </Tabs.Content>
    <Tabs.Content className={styles.Content} value="password">
      Change your password here.
    </Tabs.Content>
    <Tabs.Content className={styles.Content} value="billing">
      Manage your billing and payment details.
    </Tabs.Content>
  </Tabs.Root>
)

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Tabs } from '@ark-ui/solid/tabs'

    </Tabs.Content>
    <Tabs.Content class={styles.Content} value="password">
      Change your password here.
    </Tabs.Content>
    <Tabs.Content class={styles.Content} value="billing">
      Manage your billing and payment details.
    </Tabs.Content>
  </Tabs.Root>
)

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">

export const Vertical = () => (
  <Tabs.Root className={styles.Root} orientation="vertical" defaultValue="account">

### Lazy Mount

Lazy mounting is a feature that allows the content of a tab to be rendered only when the tab is first activated. This is
useful for performance optimization, especially when tab content is large or complex. To enable lazy mounting, use the
`lazyMount` prop on the `Tabs.Content` component.

In addition, the `unmountOnExit` prop can be used in conjunction with `lazyMount` to unmount the tab content when the
tab is deactivated, freeing up resources. The next time the tab is activated, its content will be re-rendered.

**Example: lazy-mount**

#### React

```tsx
import { Tabs } from '@ark-ui/react/tabs'
import styles from 'styles/tabs.module.css'

export const LazyMount = () => (
  <Tabs.Root className={styles.Root} lazyMount unmountOnExit defaultValue="account">
    <Tabs.List className={styles.List}>
      <Tabs.Trigger className={styles.TriggerIndicator} value="account">
        Account
      </Tabs.Trigger>
      <Tabs.Trigger className={styles.TriggerIndicator} value="password">
        Password
      </Tabs.Trigger>
      <Tabs.Trigger className={styles.TriggerIndicator} value="billing">
        Billing
      </Tabs.Trigger>
      <Tabs.Indicator className={styles.Indicator} />
    </Tabs.List>
    <Tabs.Content className={styles.Content} value="account">
      Make changes to your account here.
    </Tabs.Content>
    <Tabs.Content className={styles.Content} value="password">
      Change your password here.
    </Tabs.Content>
    <Tabs.Content className={styles.Content} value="billing">
      Manage your billing and payment details.
    </Tabs.Content>
  </Tabs.Root>
)

```

    <Tabs.List class={styles.List}>
      <Tabs.Trigger class={styles.TriggerIndicator} value="account">
        Account
      </Tabs.Trigger>
      <Tabs.Trigger class={styles.TriggerIndicator} value="password">

  <Tabs.Content class={styles.Content} value="billing">Manage your billing and payment details.</Tabs.Content>
</Tabs.Root>

```

### Manual Activation

By default, the tab can be selected when it receives focus from either the keyboard or pointer interaction. This is
called automatic tab activation.

In contrast, manual tab activation means the tab is selected with the

<kbd>Enter</kbd> key or by clicking on the tab.

**Example: manual-activation**

#### React

```tsx
import { Tabs } from '@ark-ui/react/tabs'
import styles from 'styles/tabs.module.css'

export const ManualActivation = () => (
  <Tabs.Root className={styles.Root} activationMode="manual" defaultValue="account">
    <Tabs.List className={styles.List}>
      <Tabs.Trigger className={styles.Trigger} value="account">
        Account
      </Tabs.Trigger>
      <Tabs.Trigger className={styles.Trigger} value="password">
        Password
      </Tabs.Trigger>
      <Tabs.Trigger className={styles.Trigger} value="billing">
        Billing
      </Tabs.Trigger>
    </Tabs.List>
    <Tabs.Content className={styles.Content} value="account">
      Make changes to your account here.
    </Tabs.Content>
    <Tabs.Content className={styles.Content} value="password">
      Change your password here.
    </Tabs.Content>
    <Tabs.Content className={styles.Content} value="billing">
      Manage your billing and payment details.
    </Tabs.Content>
  </Tabs.Root>
)

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Tabs } from '@ark-ui/solid/tabs'
import styles from 'styles/tabs.module.css'

export const ManualActivation = () => (
  <Tabs.Root class={styles.Root} activationMode="manual" defaultValue="account">
    <Tabs.List class={styles.List}>
      <Tabs.Trigger class={styles.Trigger} value="account">
        Account
      </Tabs.Trigger>
      <Tabs.Trigger class={styles.Trigger} value="password">
        Password
      </Tabs.Trigger>
      <Tabs.Trigger class={styles.Trigger} value="billing">

      </Tabs.Trigger>
    </Tabs.List>
    <Tabs.Content class={styles.Content} value="account">
      Make changes to your account here.
    </Tabs.Content>
    <Tabs.Content class={styles.Content} value="password">
      Change your password here.
    </Tabs.Content>
    <Tabs.Content class={styles.Content} value="billing">
      Manage your billing and payment details.
    </Tabs.Content>
  </Tabs.Root>
)

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Tabs } from '@ark-ui/vue/tabs'
import styles from 'styles/tabs.module.css'
</script>

<template>
  <Tabs.Root :class="styles.Root" activation-mode="manual" default-value="account">

      <Tabs.Trigger :class="styles.Trigger" value="account">Account</Tabs.Trigger>
      <Tabs.Trigger :class="styles.Trigger" value="password">Password</Tabs.Trigger>
      <Tabs.Trigger :class="styles.Trigger" value="billing">Billing</Tabs.Trigger>

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Tabs } from '@ark-ui/svelte/tabs'
  import styles from 'styles/tabs.module.css'

<Tabs.Root class={styles.Root} activationMode="manual" defaultValue="account">
  <Tabs.List class={styles.List}>
    <Tabs.Trigger class={styles.Trigger} value="account">Account</Tabs.Trigger>
    <Tabs.Trigger class={styles.Trigger} value="password">Password</Tabs.Trigger>
    <Tabs.Trigger class={styles.Trigger} value="billing">Billing</Tabs.Trigger>
  </Tabs.List>
  <Tabs.Content class={styles.Content} value="account">Make changes to your account here.</Tabs.Content>
  <Tabs.Content class={styles.Content} value="password">Change your password here.</Tabs.Content>
  <Tabs.Content class={styles.Content} value="billing">Manage your billing and payment details.</Tabs.Content>
</Tabs.Root>

```

### Links

Use the `asChild` prop to render tab triggers as anchor links. This is useful for SEO and allows tabs to work with
browser navigation.

**Example: links**

#### React

```tsx
import { Tabs } from '@ark-ui/react/tabs'
import styles from 'styles/tabs.module.css'

export const Links = () => (
  <Tabs.Root className={styles.Root} defaultValue="account">
    <Tabs.List className={styles.List}>
      <Tabs.Trigger className={styles.Trigger} value="account" asChild>
        <a href="#account">Account</a>
      </Tabs.Trigger>
      <Tabs.Trigger className={styles.Trigger} value="password" asChild>
        <a href="#password">Password</a>
      </Tabs.Trigger>
      <Tabs.Trigger className={styles.Trigger} value="billing" asChild>
        <a href="#billing">Billing</a>
      </Tabs.Trigger>
    </Tabs.List>
    <Tabs.Content className={styles.Content} value="account">
      Make changes to your account here.
    </Tabs.Content>
    <Tabs.Content className={styles.Content} value="password">
      Change your password here.
    </Tabs.Content>
    <Tabs.Content className={styles.Content} value="billing">
      Manage your billing and payment details.
    </Tabs.Content>
  </Tabs.Root>
)

```

### Router Integration

When using frameworks like Next.js, Remix, or React Router, controlling the active tabs based on the URL can be useful.

To achieve this, you need to do two things:

- Set the `value` prop to the current URL path.
- Listen to the `onValueChange` event and update the URL path.

Here's an example using Remix Router

```tsx
import { Tabs } from '@ark-ui/<framework>/tabs'
import { useLocation, useNavigate, Link } from '@remix-run/react'

export default function App() {
  const { pathname } = useLocation()
  const navigate = useNavigate()
  const lastPathFragment = pathname.substring(pathname.lastIndexOf('/') + 1)
  const activeTab = lastPathFragment.length > 0 ? lastPathFragment : 'homepage'

  return (
    <Tabs.Root
      value={activeTab}
      onValueChange={({ value }) => {
        navigate(`/${value === 'home' ? '' : value}`)
      }}
    >
      <Tabs.List>
        <Tabs.Trigger asChild value="home">
          <Link to="">Home</Link>
        </Tabs.Trigger>
        <Tabs.Trigger asChild value="page-1">
          <Link to="page-1">Page 1</Link>
        </Tabs.Trigger>
        <Tabs.Trigger asChild value="page-2">
          <Link to="page-2">Page 2</Link>
        </Tabs.Trigger>
      </Tabs.List>
    </Tabs.Root>
  )
}
```

      <TagsInput.Control :class="styles.Control">
        <TagsInput.Item
          v-for="(value, index) in tagsInput.value"
          :key="index"
          :index="index"
          :value="value"
          :class="styles.Item"
        >
          <TagsInput.ItemPreview :class="styles.ItemPreview">

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { TagsInput } from '@ark-ui/svelte/tags-input'
  import { XIcon } from 'lucide-svelte'
  import styles from 'styles/tags-input.module.css'
</script>

<TagsInput.Root class={styles.Root}>
  <TagsInput.Context>
    {#snippet render(tagsInput)}
      <TagsInput.Label class={styles.Label}>Frameworks</TagsInput.Label>
      <TagsInput.Control class={styles.Control}>
        {#each tagsInput().value as value, index (index)}
          <TagsInput.Item {index} {value} class={styles.Item}>
            <TagsInput.ItemPreview class={styles.ItemPreview}>

      </TagsInput.Control>
    {/snippet}
  </TagsInput.Context>
  <TagsInput.HiddenInput />
</TagsInput.Root>

```

### Controlled

Use the `value` and `onValueChange` props to programmatically control the tags input's state. This allows you to manage
the tags array externally and respond to changes.

**Example: controlled**

#### React

```tsx
import { TagsInput } from '@ark-ui/react/tags-input'
import { XIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import { useState } from 'react'
import styles from 'styles/tags-input.module.css'

export const Controlled = () => {
  const [value, setValue] = useState<string[]>(['React', 'Solid'])

  return (
    <TagsInput.Root className={styles.Root} value={value} onValueChange={(details) => setValue(details.value)}>
      <TagsInput.Context>
        {(api) => (
          <>
            <TagsInput.Label className={styles.Label}>Frameworks</TagsInput.Label>
            <TagsInput.Control className={styles.Control}>
              {api.value.map((value, index) => (
                <TagsInput.Item key={index} index={index} value={value} className={styles.Item}>
                  <TagsInput.ItemPreview className={styles.ItemPreview}>
                    <TagsInput.ItemText className={styles.ItemText}>{value}</TagsInput.ItemText>
                    <TagsInput.ItemDeleteTrigger className={styles.ItemDeleteTrigger}>
                      <XIcon />
                    </TagsInput.ItemDeleteTrigger>
                  </TagsInput.ItemPreview>
                  <TagsInput.ItemInput className={styles.ItemInput} />
                </TagsInput.Item>
              ))}
              <TagsInput.Input placeholder="Add Framework" className={styles.Input} />
              <TagsInput.ClearTrigger className={styles.ClearTrigger}>
                <XIcon />
              </TagsInput.ClearTrigger>
            </TagsInput.Control>
          </>

      <TagsInput.Control class={styles.Control}>
        {#each tagsInput().value as value, index (index)}
          <TagsInput.Item {index} {value} class={styles.Item}>
            <TagsInput.ItemPreview class={styles.ItemPreview}>
              <TagsInput.ItemText class={styles.ItemText}>{value}</TagsInput.ItemText>
              <TagsInput.ItemDeleteTrigger class={styles.ItemDeleteTrigger}>

            </TagsInput.ItemPreview>
            <TagsInput.ItemInput class={styles.ItemInput} />
          </TagsInput.Item>
        {/each}
        <TagsInput.Input placeholder="Add Framework" class={styles.Input} />
        <TagsInput.ClearTrigger class={styles.ClearTrigger}>
          <XIcon />
        </TagsInput.ClearTrigger>
      </TagsInput.Control>
    {/snippet}
  </TagsInput.Context>
  <TagsInput.HiddenInput />
</TagsInput.Root>

```

### Controlled Input Value

Use the `inputValue` and `onInputValueChange` props to control the text input field independently. This is useful for
clearing the input or pre-filling it programmatically.

**Example: controlled-input-value**

#### React

```tsx
import { TagsInput } from '@ark-ui/react/tags-input'
import { XIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import { useState } from 'react'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/tags-input.module.css'

export const ControlledInputValue = () => {
  const [inputValue, setInputValue] = useState('')

  return (
    <div className="stack">
      <div style={{ display: 'flex', gap: '8px', alignItems: 'center' }}>
        <button className={button.Root} type="button" onClick={() => setInputValue('React')}>
          Set to "React"
        </button>
        <button className={button.Root} type="button" onClick={() => setInputValue('')}>
          Clear Input
        </button>
        <span style={{ fontSize: '14px' }}>Current: "{inputValue}"</span>
      </div>

      <TagsInput.Root
        className={styles.Root}
        inputValue={inputValue}
        onInputValueChange={(details) => setInputValue(details.inputValue)}
      >
        <TagsInput.Context>
          {(tagsInput) => (
            <>
              <TagsInput.Label className={styles.Label}>Frameworks</TagsInput.Label>
              <TagsInput.Control className={styles.Control}>
                {tagsInput.value.map((value, index) => (
                  <TagsInput.Item key={index} index={index} value={value} className={styles.Item}>
                    <TagsInput.ItemPreview className={styles.ItemPreview}>
                      <TagsInput.ItemText className={styles.ItemText}>{value}</TagsInput.ItemText>
                      <TagsInput.ItemDeleteTrigger className={styles.ItemDeleteTrigger}>
                        <XIcon />
                      </TagsInput.ItemDeleteTrigger>
                    </TagsInput.ItemPreview>
                    <TagsInput.ItemInput className={styles.ItemInput} />
                  </TagsInput.Item>
                ))}
                <TagsInput.Input placeholder="Add Framework" className={styles.Input} />
                <TagsInput.ClearTrigger className={styles.ClearTrigger}>
                  <XIcon />
                </TagsInput.ClearTrigger>
              </TagsInput.Control>
            </>
          )}
        </TagsInput.Context>
        <TagsInput.HiddenInput />
      </TagsInput.Root>
    </div>
  )
}

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { TagsInput } from '@ark-ui/solid/tags-input'
import { XIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { Index, createSignal } from 'solid-js'
import styles from 'styles/tags-input.module.css'

export const ControlledInputValue = () => {
  const [inputValue, setInputValue] = createSignal('')

  return (
    <TagsInput.Root
      inputValue={inputValue()}
      onInputValueChange={(details) => setInputValue(details.inputValue)}
      class={styles.Root}
    >
      <TagsInput.Context>
        {(api) => (
          <>
            <TagsInput.Label class={styles.Label}>Frameworks</TagsInput.Label>
            <TagsInput.Control class={styles.Control}>
              <Index each={api().value}>
                {(value, index) => (
                  <TagsInput.Item index={index} value={value()} class={styles.Item}>
                    <TagsInput.ItemPreview class={styles.ItemPreview}>

                  </TagsInput.Item>
                )}
              </Index>
              <TagsInput.Input placeholder="Add Framework" class={styles.Input} />
              <TagsInput.ClearTrigger class={styles.ClearTrigger}>
                <XIcon />
              </TagsInput.ClearTrigger>
            </TagsInput.Control>
          </>
        )}
      </TagsInput.Context>
      <TagsInput.HiddenInput />
    </TagsInput.Root>
  )
}

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { TagsInput } from '@ark-ui/vue/tags-input'
import { XIcon } from 'lucide-vue-next'
import { ref } from 'vue'
import styles from 'styles/tags-input.module.css'

const inputValue = ref('')
</script>

<template>
  <TagsInput.Root
    :input-value="inputValue"
    :class="styles.Root"
    @input-value-change="(details) => (inputValue = details.inputValue)"
  >
    <TagsInput.Context v-slot="tagsInput">
      <TagsInput.Label :class="styles.Label">Frameworks</TagsInput.Label>
      <TagsInput.Control :class="styles.Control">
        <TagsInput.Item
          v-for="(value, index) in tagsInput.value"
          :key="index"
          :index="index"
          :value="value"
          :class="styles.Item"
        >
          <TagsInput.ItemPreview :class="styles.ItemPreview">
            <TagsInput.ItemText :class="styles.ItemText">{{ value }}</TagsInput.ItemText>
            <TagsInput.ItemDeleteTrigger :class="styles.ItemDeleteTrigger">
              <XIcon />

          <TagsInput.ItemInput :class="styles.ItemInput" />
        </TagsInput.Item>
        <TagsInput.Input placeholder="Add Framework" :class="styles.Input" />
        <TagsInput.ClearTrigger :class="styles.ClearTrigger">
          <XIcon />
        </TagsInput.ClearTrigger>
      </TagsInput.Control>
    </TagsInput.Context>
    <TagsInput.HiddenInput />
  </TagsInput.Root>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { TagsInput } from '@ark-ui/svelte/tags-input'
  import { XIcon } from 'lucide-svelte'
  import styles from 'styles/tags-input.module.css'

  let inputValue = $state('')
</script>

<TagsInput.Root bind:inputValue class={styles.Root}>
  <TagsInput.Context>
    {#snippet render(tagsInput)}
      <TagsInput.Label class={styles.Label}>Frameworks</TagsInput.Label>
      <TagsInput.Control class={styles.Control}>
        {#each tagsInput().value as value, index (index)}
          <TagsInput.Item {index} {value} class={styles.Item}>
            <TagsInput.ItemPreview class={styles.ItemPreview}>
              <TagsInput.ItemText class={styles.ItemText}>{value}</TagsInput.ItemText>
              <TagsInput.ItemDeleteTrigger class={styles.ItemDeleteTrigger}>
                <XIcon />

        </TagsInput.ClearTrigger>
      </TagsInput.Control>
    {/snippet}
  </TagsInput.Context>
  <TagsInput.HiddenInput />
</TagsInput.Root>

```

### Root Provider

An alternative way to control the tags input is to use the `RootProvider` component and the `useTagsInput` hook. This
way you can access the state and methods from outside the component.

**Example: root-provider**

#### React

```tsx
import { TagsInput, useTagsInput } from '@ark-ui/react/tags-input'
import { XIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import styles from 'styles/tags-input.module.css'

export const RootProvider = () => {
  const tagsInput = useTagsInput()
  return (
    <div className="stack">
      <TagsInput.RootProvider className={styles.Root} value={tagsInput}>
        <TagsInput.Context>
          {(api) => (
            <>
              <TagsInput.Label className={styles.Label}>Frameworks</TagsInput.Label>
              <TagsInput.Control className={styles.Control}>
                {api.value.map((value, index) => (
                  <TagsInput.Item key={index} index={index} value={value} className={styles.Item}>
                    <TagsInput.ItemPreview className={styles.ItemPreview}>
                      <TagsInput.ItemText className={styles.ItemText}>{value}</TagsInput.ItemText>
                      <TagsInput.ItemDeleteTrigger className={styles.ItemDeleteTrigger}>
                        <XIcon />
                      </TagsInput.ItemDeleteTrigger>
                    </TagsInput.ItemPreview>
                    <TagsInput.ItemInput className={styles.ItemInput} />
                  </TagsInput.Item>
                ))}
                <TagsInput.Input placeholder="Add Framework" className={styles.Input} />
                <TagsInput.ClearTrigger className={styles.ClearTrigger}>
                  <XIcon />
                </TagsInput.ClearTrigger>
              </TagsInput.Control>
            </>
          )}
        </TagsInput.Context>
        <TagsInput.HiddenInput />
      </TagsInput.RootProvider>

      <output>values: {JSON.stringify(tagsInput.value)}</output>
    </div>
  )
}

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { TagsInput, useTagsInput } from '@ark-ui/solid/tags-input'
import { XIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { Index } from 'solid-js'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/tags-input.module.css'

export const RootProvider = () => {
  const tagsInput = useTagsInput()

  return (
    <div class="stack">
      <button class={button.Root} onClick={() => tagsInput().focus()}>
        Focus
      </button>

      <TagsInput.RootProvider value={tagsInput} class={styles.Root}>
        <TagsInput.Context>

                  {(value, index) => (
                    <TagsInput.Item index={index} value={value()} class={styles.Item}>
                      <TagsInput.ItemPreview class={styles.ItemPreview}>
                        <TagsInput.ItemText class={styles.ItemText}>{value()}</TagsInput.ItemText>
                        <TagsInput.ItemDeleteTrigger class={styles.ItemDeleteTrigger}>
                          <XIcon />
                        </TagsInput.ItemDeleteTrigger>
                      </TagsInput.ItemPreview>
                      <TagsInput.ItemInput class={styles.ItemInput} />
                    </TagsInput.Item>

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { TagsInput, useTagsInput } from '@ark-ui/svelte/tags-input'
  import { XIcon } from 'lucide-svelte'
  import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
  import styles from 'styles/tags-input.module.css'

  const id = $props.id()

  const tagsInput = useTagsInput({
    id,
    defaultValue: ['React', 'Svelte'],
  })
</script>

<div class="stack">

### Field

The `Field` component helps manage form-related state and accessibility attributes of a tags input. It includes handling
ARIA labels, helper text, and error text to ensure proper accessibility.

**Example: with-field**

#### React

```tsx
import { Field } from '@ark-ui/react/field'
import { TagsInput } from '@ark-ui/react/tags-input'
import { XIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import field from 'styles/field.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/tags-input.module.css'

export const WithField = () => {
  return (
    <Field.Root className={field.Root}>
      <TagsInput.Root className={styles.Root}>
        <TagsInput.Context>
          {(tagsInput) => (
            <>
              <TagsInput.Label className={styles.Label}>Frameworks</TagsInput.Label>
              <TagsInput.Control className={styles.Control}>
                {tagsInput.value.map((value, index) => (
                  <TagsInput.Item key={index} index={index} value={value} className={styles.Item}>
                    <TagsInput.ItemPreview className={styles.ItemPreview}>
                      <TagsInput.ItemText className={styles.ItemText}>{value}</TagsInput.ItemText>
                      <TagsInput.ItemDeleteTrigger className={styles.ItemDeleteTrigger}>
                        <XIcon />
                      </TagsInput.ItemDeleteTrigger>
                    </TagsInput.ItemPreview>
                    <TagsInput.ItemInput className={styles.ItemInput} />
                  </TagsInput.Item>
                ))}
                <TagsInput.Input placeholder="Add Framework" className={styles.Input} />
                <TagsInput.ClearTrigger className={styles.ClearTrigger}>
                  <XIcon />
                </TagsInput.ClearTrigger>
              </TagsInput.Control>
            </>
          )}
        </TagsInput.Context>
        <TagsInput.HiddenInput />
      </TagsInput.Root>
      <Field.HelperText className={field.HelperText}>Additional Info</Field.HelperText>
      <Field.ErrorText className={field.ErrorText}>Error Info</Field.ErrorText>
    </Field.Root>
  )
}

```

#### Solid

import { Field } from '@ark-ui/solid/field'
import { TagsInput } from '@ark-ui/solid/tags-input'
import { XIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { Index } from 'solid-js'

### Max Tags

To limit the number of tags within the component, you can set the `max` property to the limit you want. The default
value is `Infinity`.

When the tag reaches the limit, new tags cannot be added except the `allowOverflow` prop is set to `true`.

**Example: max-with-overflow**

#### React

```tsx
import { TagsInput } from '@ark-ui/react/tags-input'
import { XIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import styles from 'styles/tags-input.module.css'

export const MaxWithOverflow = () => {
  return (
    <TagsInput.Root className={styles.Root} max={3} allowOverflow>
      <TagsInput.Context>
        {(tagsInput) => (
          <>
            <TagsInput.Label className={styles.Label}>Frameworks</TagsInput.Label>
            <TagsInput.Control className={styles.Control}>
              {tagsInput.value.map((value, index) => (
                <TagsInput.Item key={index} index={index} value={value} className={styles.Item}>
                  <TagsInput.ItemPreview className={styles.ItemPreview}>
                    <TagsInput.ItemText className={styles.ItemText}>{value}</TagsInput.ItemText>
                    <TagsInput.ItemDeleteTrigger className={styles.ItemDeleteTrigger}>
                      <XIcon />
                    </TagsInput.ItemDeleteTrigger>
                  </TagsInput.ItemPreview>
                  <TagsInput.ItemInput className={styles.ItemInput} />
                </TagsInput.Item>
              ))}
              <TagsInput.Input placeholder="Add Framework" className={styles.Input} />
              <TagsInput.ClearTrigger className={styles.ClearTrigger}>
                <XIcon />
              </TagsInput.ClearTrigger>
            </TagsInput.Control>
          </>
        )}
      </TagsInput.Context>
      <TagsInput.HiddenInput />
    </TagsInput.Root>
  )
}

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { TagsInput } from '@ark-ui/solid/tags-input'
import { XIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { Index } from 'solid-js'
import styles from 'styles/tags-input.module.css'

                  </TagsInput.Item>
                )}
              </Index>
              <TagsInput.Input placeholder="Add Framework" class={styles.Input} />
              <TagsInput.ClearTrigger class={styles.ClearTrigger}>

  <TagsInput.HiddenInput />
</TagsInput.Root>

```

### Custom Delimiter

Use the `delimiter` prop with a regex pattern to specify multiple characters that can separate tags. By default, only
the Enter key creates tags.

**Example: delimiter**

#### React

```tsx
import { TagsInput } from '@ark-ui/react/tags-input'
import { XIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import styles from 'styles/tags-input.module.css'

const DELIMITER_PATTERN = /[,;\s]/

export const Delimiter = () => {
  return (
    <TagsInput.Root className={styles.Root} delimiter={DELIMITER_PATTERN}>
      <TagsInput.Context>
        {(tagsInput) => (
          <>
            <TagsInput.Label className={styles.Label}>Frameworks (add with comma, semicolon, or space)</TagsInput.Label>
            <TagsInput.Control className={styles.Control}>
              {tagsInput.value.map((value, index) => (
                <TagsInput.Item key={index} index={index} value={value} className={styles.Item}>
                  <TagsInput.ItemPreview className={styles.ItemPreview}>
                    <TagsInput.ItemText className={styles.ItemText}>{value}</TagsInput.ItemText>
                    <TagsInput.ItemDeleteTrigger className={styles.ItemDeleteTrigger}>
                      <XIcon />
                    </TagsInput.ItemDeleteTrigger>
                  </TagsInput.ItemPreview>
                  <TagsInput.ItemInput className={styles.ItemInput} />
                </TagsInput.Item>
              ))}
              <TagsInput.Input placeholder="Add tag" className={styles.Input} />
              <TagsInput.ClearTrigger className={styles.ClearTrigger}>
                <XIcon />
              </TagsInput.ClearTrigger>
            </TagsInput.Control>
          </>
        )}
      </TagsInput.Context>
      <TagsInput.HiddenInput />
    </TagsInput.Root>
  )
}

```

### Disabled

Use the `disabled` prop to make the tags input non-interactive. Users won't be able to add, remove, or edit tags.

**Example: disabled**

#### React

```tsx
import { TagsInput } from '@ark-ui/react/tags-input'
import { XIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import styles from 'styles/tags-input.module.css'

export const Disabled = () => {
  return (
    <TagsInput.Root className={styles.Root} defaultValue={['React', 'Solid', 'Vue']} disabled>
      <TagsInput.Context>
        {(tagsInput) => (
          <>
            <TagsInput.Label className={styles.Label}>Frameworks</TagsInput.Label>
            <TagsInput.Control className={styles.Control}>
              {tagsInput.value.map((value, index) => (
                <TagsInput.Item key={index} index={index} value={value} className={styles.Item}>
                  <TagsInput.ItemPreview className={styles.ItemPreview}>
                    <TagsInput.ItemText className={styles.ItemText}>{value}</TagsInput.ItemText>
                    <TagsInput.ItemDeleteTrigger className={styles.ItemDeleteTrigger}>
                      <XIcon />
                    </TagsInput.ItemDeleteTrigger>
                  </TagsInput.ItemPreview>
                  <TagsInput.ItemInput className={styles.ItemInput} />
                </TagsInput.Item>

### Invalid

Use the `invalid` prop to mark the tags input as invalid for form validation purposes.

**Example: invalid**

#### React

```tsx
import { TagsInput } from '@ark-ui/react/tags-input'
import { XIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import styles from 'styles/tags-input.module.css'

export const Invalid = () => {
  return (
    <TagsInput.Root className={styles.Root} invalid>
      <TagsInput.Context>
        {(tagsInput) => (
          <>
            <TagsInput.Label className={styles.Label}>Frameworks</TagsInput.Label>
            <TagsInput.Control className={styles.Control}>
              {tagsInput.value.map((value, index) => (
                <TagsInput.Item key={index} index={index} value={value} className={styles.Item}>
                  <TagsInput.ItemPreview className={styles.ItemPreview}>
                    <TagsInput.ItemText className={styles.ItemText}>{value}</TagsInput.ItemText>

                      <XIcon />
                    </TagsInput.ItemDeleteTrigger>
                  </TagsInput.ItemPreview>
                  <TagsInput.ItemInput className={styles.ItemInput} />
                </TagsInput.Item>
              ))}
              <TagsInput.Input placeholder="Add Framework" className={styles.Input} />
              <TagsInput.ClearTrigger className={styles.ClearTrigger}>
                <XIcon />
              </TagsInput.ClearTrigger>
            </TagsInput.Control>
          </>
        )}
      </TagsInput.Context>
      <TagsInput.HiddenInput />
    </TagsInput.Root>
  )
}

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { TagsInput } from '@ark-ui/solid/tags-input'

            <TagsInput.Control class={styles.Control}>
              <Index each={api().value}>
                {(value, index) => (
                  <TagsInput.Item index={index} value={value()} class={styles.Item}>

                    <TagsInput.ItemInput class={styles.ItemInput} />
                  </TagsInput.Item>
                )}
              </Index>
              <TagsInput.Input placeholder="Add Framework" class={styles.Input} />
              <TagsInput.ClearTrigger class={styles.ClearTrigger}>
                <XIcon />
              </TagsInput.ClearTrigger>

          :index="index"
          :value="value"
          :class="styles.Item"
        >

      </TagsInput.Control>
    </TagsInput.Context>
    <TagsInput.HiddenInput />
  </TagsInput.Root>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte

    {#snippet render(tagsInput)}
      <TagsInput.Label class={styles.Label}>Frameworks</TagsInput.Label>
      <TagsInput.Control class={styles.Control}>
        {#each tagsInput().value as value, index (index)}
          <TagsInput.Item {index} {value} class={styles.Item}>

      </TagsInput.Control>
    {/snippet}
  </TagsInput.Context>
  <TagsInput.HiddenInput />
</TagsInput.Root>

```

### Max Length

Use the `maxLength` prop to limit the number of characters allowed per tag. This prevents users from creating overly
long tags.

**Example: max-tag-length**

#### React

```tsx
import { TagsInput } from '@ark-ui/react/tags-input'
import { XIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import styles from 'styles/tags-input.module.css'

export const MaxTagLength = () => {
  return (
    <TagsInput.Root className={styles.Root} maxLength={10}>
      <TagsInput.Context>
        {(tagsInput) => (
          <>
            <TagsInput.Label className={styles.Label}>Frameworks (Max 10 characters)</TagsInput.Label>
            <TagsInput.Control className={styles.Control}>
              {tagsInput.value.map((value, index) => (
                <TagsInput.Item key={index} index={index} value={value} className={styles.Item}>
                  <TagsInput.ItemPreview className={styles.ItemPreview}>
                    <TagsInput.ItemText className={styles.ItemText}>{value}</TagsInput.ItemText>
                    <TagsInput.ItemDeleteTrigger className={styles.ItemDeleteTrigger}>
                      <XIcon />
                    </TagsInput.ItemDeleteTrigger>
                  </TagsInput.ItemPreview>
                  <TagsInput.ItemInput className={styles.ItemInput} />
                </TagsInput.Item>
              ))}
              <TagsInput.Input placeholder="Add Framework" className={styles.Input} />
              <TagsInput.ClearTrigger className={styles.ClearTrigger}>
                <XIcon />
              </TagsInput.ClearTrigger>
            </TagsInput.Control>
          </>
        )}
      </TagsInput.Context>
      <TagsInput.HiddenInput />
    </TagsInput.Root>
  )
}

```

#### Solid

          <>
            <TagsInput.Label class={styles.Label}>Frameworks</TagsInput.Label>
            <TagsInput.Control class={styles.Control}>
              <Index each={api().value}>
                {(value, index) => (

                    <TagsInput.ItemInput class={styles.ItemInput} />
                  </TagsInput.Item>
                )}
              </Index>
              <TagsInput.Input placeholder="Add Framework" class={styles.Input} />
              <TagsInput.ClearTrigger class={styles.ClearTrigger}>
                <XIcon />
              </TagsInput.ClearTrigger>
            </TagsInput.Control>
          </>

  <TagsInput.HiddenInput />
</TagsInput.Root>

```

### Read-only

Use the `readOnly` prop to make tags visible but not editable. Users can view tags but cannot add, remove, or modify
them.

**Example: readonly**

#### React

```tsx
import { TagsInput } from '@ark-ui/react/tags-input'
import { XIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import styles from 'styles/tags-input.module.css'

export const Readonly = () => {
  return (
    <TagsInput.Root className={styles.Root} defaultValue={['React', 'Solid', 'Vue']} readOnly>
      <TagsInput.Context>
        {(tagsInput) => (
          <>
            <TagsInput.Label className={styles.Label}>Frameworks</TagsInput.Label>
            <TagsInput.Control className={styles.Control}>
              {tagsInput.value.map((value, index) => (
                <TagsInput.Item key={index} index={index} value={value} className={styles.Item}>
                  <TagsInput.ItemPreview className={styles.ItemPreview}>
                    <TagsInput.ItemText className={styles.ItemText}>{value}</TagsInput.ItemText>
                    <TagsInput.ItemDeleteTrigger className={styles.ItemDeleteTrigger}>
                      <XIcon />
                    </TagsInput.ItemDeleteTrigger>
                  </TagsInput.ItemPreview>
                  <TagsInput.ItemInput className={styles.ItemInput} />
                </TagsInput.Item>
              ))}
              <TagsInput.Input placeholder="Add Framework" className={styles.Input} />

### Validation

Before a tag is added, the `validate` function is called to determine whether to accept or reject a tag.

A common use-case for validating tags is preventing duplicates or validating the data type.

**Example: validation**

#### React

```tsx
import { TagsInput } from '@ark-ui/react/tags-input'
import { XIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import styles from 'styles/tags-input.module.css'

const TAG_PATTERN = /^[a-zA-Z0-9-]+$/

const validateTag = ({ value, inputValue }: { value: string[]; inputValue: string }) =>
  !!inputValue?.trim() && !value.includes(inputValue) && inputValue.length >= 3 && TAG_PATTERN.test(inputValue)

export const Validation = () => {
  return (
    <TagsInput.Root className={styles.Root} validate={validateTag}>
      <TagsInput.Context>
        {(tagsInput) => (
          <>
            <TagsInput.Label className={styles.Label}>Frameworks (Min 3 chars, alphanumeric)</TagsInput.Label>
            <TagsInput.Control className={styles.Control}>
              {tagsInput.value.map((value, index) => (
                <TagsInput.Item key={index} index={index} value={value} className={styles.Item}>
                  <TagsInput.ItemPreview className={styles.ItemPreview}>
                    <TagsInput.ItemText className={styles.ItemText}>{value}</TagsInput.ItemText>
                    <TagsInput.ItemDeleteTrigger className={styles.ItemDeleteTrigger}>
                      <XIcon />
                    </TagsInput.ItemDeleteTrigger>
                  </TagsInput.ItemPreview>
                  <TagsInput.ItemInput className={styles.ItemInput} />
                </TagsInput.Item>
              ))}
              <TagsInput.Input placeholder="Add Framework" className={styles.Input} />
              <TagsInput.ClearTrigger className={styles.ClearTrigger}>
                <XIcon />
              </TagsInput.ClearTrigger>
            </TagsInput.Control>
          </>

### Blur behavior

When the tags input is blurred, you can configure the action the component should take by passing the `blurBehavior`
prop.

- `add` — Adds the tag to the list of tags.
- `clear` — Clears the tags input value.

**Example: blur-behavior**

#### React

```tsx
import { TagsInput } from '@ark-ui/react/tags-input'
import { XIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import styles from 'styles/tags-input.module.css'

export const BlurBehavior = () => {
  return (
    <TagsInput.Root className={styles.Root} blurBehavior="add">
      <TagsInput.Context>
        {(tagsInput) => (
          <>
            <TagsInput.Label className={styles.Label}>Frameworks</TagsInput.Label>
            <TagsInput.Control className={styles.Control}>
              {tagsInput.value.map((value, index) => (
                <TagsInput.Item key={index} index={index} value={value} className={styles.Item}>
                  <TagsInput.ItemPreview className={styles.ItemPreview}>
                    <TagsInput.ItemText className={styles.ItemText}>{value}</TagsInput.ItemText>
                    <TagsInput.ItemDeleteTrigger className={styles.ItemDeleteTrigger}>
                      <XIcon />
                    </TagsInput.ItemDeleteTrigger>
                  </TagsInput.ItemPreview>
                  <TagsInput.ItemInput className={styles.ItemInput} />
                </TagsInput.Item>
              ))}
              <TagsInput.Input placeholder="Add Framework" className={styles.Input} />
              <TagsInput.ClearTrigger className={styles.ClearTrigger}>
                <XIcon />
              </TagsInput.ClearTrigger>
            </TagsInput.Control>
          </>
        )}
      </TagsInput.Context>
      <TagsInput.HiddenInput />
    </TagsInput.Root>
  )
}

      </TagsInput.Control>
    {/snippet}
  </TagsInput.Context>
  <TagsInput.HiddenInput />
</TagsInput.Root>

```

### Paste behavior

To add a tag when a arbitrary value is pasted in the input element, pass the `addOnPaste` prop.

When a value is pasted, the component will:

- check if the value is a valid tag based on the `validate` option
- split the value by the `delimiter` option passed

**Example: paste-behavior**

#### React

```tsx
import { TagsInput } from '@ark-ui/react/tags-input'
import { XIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import styles from 'styles/tags-input.module.css'

export const PasteBehavior = () => {
  return (
    <TagsInput.Root className={styles.Root} addOnPaste delimiter=",">
      <TagsInput.Context>
        {(tagsInput) => (
          <>
            <TagsInput.Label className={styles.Label}>Frameworks</TagsInput.Label>
            <TagsInput.Control className={styles.Control}>
              {tagsInput.value.map((value, index) => (
                <TagsInput.Item key={index} index={index} value={value} className={styles.Item}>

### Disable Editing

by default the tags can be edited by double-clicking on the tag or focusing on them and pressing

<kbd>Enter</kbd>. To disable this behavior, pass `editable={false}`

**Example: disabled-editing**

#### React

```tsx
import { TagsInput } from '@ark-ui/react/tags-input'
import { XIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import styles from 'styles/tags-input.module.css'

export const DisabledEditing = () => {
  return (
    <TagsInput.Root className={styles.Root} editable={false}>
      <TagsInput.Context>
        {(tagsInput) => (
          <>
            <TagsInput.Label className={styles.Label}>Frameworks</TagsInput.Label>
            <TagsInput.Control className={styles.Control}>
              {tagsInput.value.map((value, index) => (
                <TagsInput.Item key={index} index={index} value={value} className={styles.Item}>
                  <TagsInput.ItemPreview className={styles.ItemPreview}>
                    <TagsInput.ItemText className={styles.ItemText}>{value}</TagsInput.ItemText>
                    <TagsInput.ItemDeleteTrigger className={styles.ItemDeleteTrigger}>
                      <XIcon />
                    </TagsInput.ItemDeleteTrigger>
                  </TagsInput.ItemPreview>
                  <TagsInput.ItemInput className={styles.ItemInput} />
                </TagsInput.Item>
              ))}
              <TagsInput.Input placeholder="Add Framework" className={styles.Input} />
              <TagsInput.ClearTrigger className={styles.ClearTrigger}>
                <XIcon />
              </TagsInput.ClearTrigger>
            </TagsInput.Control>
          </>
        )}
      </TagsInput.Context>
      <TagsInput.HiddenInput />
    </TagsInput.Root>
  )
}

```

#### Solid

                )}
              </Index>

      </TagsInput.Control>
    {/snippet}
  </TagsInput.Context>
  <TagsInput.HiddenInput />
</TagsInput.Root>

```

### Programmatic Control

Use the `useTagsInput` hook with `RootProvider` to access the component's API methods like `addValue()`, `setValue()`,
and `clearValue()` for full programmatic control.

**Example: programmatic-control**

#### React

```tsx
import { TagsInput, useTagsInput } from '@ark-ui/react/tags-input'
import { XIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/tags-input.module.css'

export const ProgrammaticControl = () => {
  const tagsInput = useTagsInput()

  return (
    <div className="stack">
      <div style={{ display: 'flex', gap: '8px' }}>
        <button className={button.Root} type="button" onClick={() => tagsInput.addValue('React')}>
          Add React
        </button>
        <button className={button.Root} type="button" onClick={() => tagsInput.addValue('Solid')}>
          Add Solid
        </button>
        <button className={button.Root} type="button" onClick={() => tagsInput.setValue(['Vue', 'Svelte'])}>
          Set to Vue & Svelte
        </button>
        <button className={button.Root} type="button" onClick={() => tagsInput.clearValue()}>
          Clear All
        </button>
      </div>

      <TagsInput.RootProvider className={styles.Root} value={tagsInput}>
        <TagsInput.Context>
          {(api) => (
            <>
              <TagsInput.Label className={styles.Label}>Frameworks</TagsInput.Label>
              <TagsInput.Control className={styles.Control}>
                {api.value.map((value, index) => (
                  <TagsInput.Item key={index} index={index} value={value} className={styles.Item}>
                    <TagsInput.ItemPreview className={styles.ItemPreview}>
                      <TagsInput.ItemText className={styles.ItemText}>{value}</TagsInput.ItemText>
                      <TagsInput.ItemDeleteTrigger className={styles.ItemDeleteTrigger}>

                ))}
                <TagsInput.Input placeholder="Add Framework" className={styles.Input} />
                <TagsInput.ClearTrigger className={styles.ClearTrigger}>
                  <XIcon />
                </TagsInput.ClearTrigger>
              </TagsInput.Control>

### Combobox

Combine TagsInput with Combobox to create an autocomplete tags input. This pattern uses shared IDs between both
components and the `asChild` prop to compose the inputs together.

**Example: with-combobox**

#### React

```tsx
import { Combobox, useCombobox, useListCollection } from '@ark-ui/react/combobox'
import { useFilter } from '@ark-ui/react/locale'
import { Portal } from '@ark-ui/react/portal'
import { TagsInput, useTagsInput } from '@ark-ui/react/tags-input'
import { CheckIcon, XIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import { useId } from 'react'
import combobox from 'styles/combobox.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/tags-input.module.css'

export const WithCombobox = () => {
  const { contains } = useFilter({ sensitivity: 'base' })

  const { collection, filter } = useListCollection({
    initialItems: ['React', 'Solid', 'Vue', 'Svelte', 'Angular', 'Preact', 'Next.js', 'Astro', 'Nuxt'],
    filter: contains,
  })

  const uid = useId()

  const tagsInput = useTagsInput({
    ids: { input: `input_${uid}`, control: `control_${uid}` },
  })

  const comboboxApi = useCombobox({
    ids: { input: `input_${uid}`, control: `control_${uid}` },
    collection,
    onInputValueChange(details) {
      filter(details.inputValue)
    },
    value: [],
    allowCustomValue: true,
    onValueChange: (details) => {
      if (details.value[0]) {
        tagsInput.addValue(details.value[0])
      }
    },
    selectionBehavior: 'clear',
  })

  return (
    <Combobox.RootProvider value={comboboxApi}>

          <Combobox.Input asChild>
            <TagsInput.Input placeholder="Add Framework" className={styles.Input} />
          </Combobox.Input>
          <TagsInput.ClearTrigger className={styles.ClearTrigger}>
            <XIcon />
          </TagsInput.ClearTrigger>
        </TagsInput.Control>
        <TagsInput.HiddenInput />
      </TagsInput.RootProvider>

      <Portal>
        <Combobox.Positioner>
          <Combobox.Content className={combobox.Content}>
            <Combobox.Empty className={combobox.Item}>No frameworks found</Combobox.Empty>

                  <CheckIcon />
                </Combobox.ItemIndicator>
              </Combobox.Item>
            ))}
          </Combobox.Content>
        </Combobox.Positioner>
      </Portal>
    </Combobox.RootProvider>
  )
}

```

## Guides

### Navigation

When the input has an empty value or the caret is at the start position, the tags can be selected by using the arrow
left and arrow right keys. When "visual" focus in on any tag:

- Pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd> or double-clicking on the tag will put it in edit mode, allowing the user change its value
  and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to commit the changes.
- Pressing <kbd>Delete</kbd> or <kbd>Backspace</kbd> will delete the tag that has _visual_ focus.

| `autoFocus` | `boolean` | No | Whether the input should be auto-focused |
| `blurBehavior` | `'clear' | 'add'` | No | The behavior of the tags input when the input is blurred
- `"add"`: add the input value as a new tag
- `"clear"`: clear the input value |
| `defaultInputValue` | `string` | No | The initial tag input value when rendered.
Use when you don't need to control the tag input value. |
| `defaultValue` | `string[]` | No | The initial tag value when rendered.
Use when you don't need to control the tag value. |
| `delimiter` | `string | RegExp` | No | The character that serves has:
- event key to trigger the addition of a new tag
- character used to split tags when pasting into the input |
| `disabled` | `boolean` | No | Whether the tags input should be disabled |
| `editable` | `boolean` | No | Whether a tag can be edited after creation, by pressing `Enter` or double clicking. |
| `form` | `string` | No | The associate form of the underlying input element. |
| `id` | `string` | No | The unique identifier of the machine. |
| `ids` | `Partial<{
  root: string
  input: string

```

### Countdown

You can create a countdown timer by setting the `countdown` prop to `true` and `startMs` to the initial time:

**Example: countdown**

#### React

```tsx
import { Timer } from '@ark-ui/react/timer'
import { PauseIcon, PlayIcon, RotateCcwIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/timer.module.css'

export const Countdown = () => (
  <Timer.Root className="stack" countdown startMs={5 * 60 * 1000}>
    <Timer.Area className={styles.Area}>
      <div className={styles.ItemGroup}>
        <Timer.Item className={styles.Item} type="minutes" />
        <span className={styles.ItemLabel}>minutes</span>
      </div>
      <Timer.Separator className={styles.Separator}>:</Timer.Separator>
      <div className={styles.ItemGroup}>
        <Timer.Item className={styles.Item} type="seconds" />
        <span className={styles.ItemLabel}>seconds</span>
      </div>
    </Timer.Area>
    <Timer.Control className="hstack">
      <Timer.ActionTrigger className={button.Root} action="start">
        <PlayIcon /> Start
      </Timer.ActionTrigger>
      <Timer.ActionTrigger className={button.Root} action="pause">
        <PauseIcon /> Pause
      </Timer.ActionTrigger>
      <Timer.ActionTrigger className={button.Root} action="reset">
        <RotateCcwIcon /> Reset
      </Timer.ActionTrigger>
    </Timer.Control>
  </Timer.Root>
)

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Timer } from '@ark-ui/solid/timer'
import { PauseIcon, PlayIcon, RotateCcwIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/timer.module.css'

export const Countdown = () => (
  <Timer.Root class="stack" countdown startMs={5 * 60 * 1000}>
    <Timer.Area class={styles.Area}>
      <div class={styles.ItemGroup}>
        <Timer.Item class={styles.Item} type="minutes" />
        <span class={styles.ItemLabel}>minutes</span>
      </div>
      <Timer.Separator class={styles.Separator}>:</Timer.Separator>
      <div class={styles.ItemGroup}>
        <Timer.Item class={styles.Item} type="seconds" />
        <span class={styles.ItemLabel}>seconds</span>
      </div>
    </Timer.Area>
    <Timer.Control class="hstack">
      <Timer.ActionTrigger class={button.Root} action="start">
        <PlayIcon /> Start
      </Timer.ActionTrigger>
      <Timer.ActionTrigger class={button.Root} action="pause">
        <PauseIcon /> Pause
      </Timer.ActionTrigger>
      <Timer.ActionTrigger class={button.Root} action="reset">
        <RotateCcwIcon /> Reset
      </Timer.ActionTrigger>
    </Timer.Control>
  </Timer.Root>
)

```

import { Timer } from '@ark-ui/vue/timer'
import { PauseIcon, PlayIcon, RotateCcwIcon } from 'lucide-vue-next'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/timer.module.css'
</script>

<template>
  <Timer.Root class="stack" :countdown="true" :startMs="5 * 60 * 1000">
    <Timer.Area :class="styles.Area">

      </div>
    </Timer.Area>
    <Timer.Control class="hstack">
      <Timer.ActionTrigger :class="button.Root" action="start">
        <PlayIcon />
        Start
      </Timer.ActionTrigger>
      <Timer.ActionTrigger :class="button.Root" action="pause">

```

#### Svelte

```svelte

</script>

<Timer.Root class="stack" countdown startMs={5 * 60 * 1000}>
  <Timer.Area class={styles.Area}>
    <div class={styles.ItemGroup}>
      <Timer.Item class={styles.Item} type="minutes" />
      <span class={styles.ItemLabel}>minutes</span>

    <Timer.ActionTrigger class={button.Root} action="reset">
      <RotateCcwIcon /> Reset
    </Timer.ActionTrigger>
  </Timer.Control>
</Timer.Root>

```

### Interval

Use the `interval` prop to control how frequently the timer updates. This is useful for displaying milliseconds:

**Example: interval**

#### React

```tsx
import { Timer } from '@ark-ui/react/timer'
import { PauseIcon, PlayIcon, RotateCcwIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/timer.module.css'

export const Interval = () => (
  <Timer.Root className="stack" interval={100} targetMs={60 * 1000}>
    <Timer.Area className={styles.Area}>
      <div className={styles.ItemGroup}>
        <Timer.Item className={styles.Item} type="seconds" />
        <span className={styles.ItemLabel}>seconds</span>
      </div>
      <Timer.Separator className={styles.Separator}>.</Timer.Separator>
      <div className={styles.ItemGroup}>
        <Timer.Item className={styles.Item} type="milliseconds" />
        <span className={styles.ItemLabel}>ms</span>
      </div>
    </Timer.Area>
    <Timer.Control className="hstack">
      <Timer.ActionTrigger className={button.Root} action="start">
        <PlayIcon /> Start
      </Timer.ActionTrigger>
      <Timer.ActionTrigger className={button.Root} action="pause">
        <PauseIcon /> Pause
      </Timer.ActionTrigger>
      <Timer.ActionTrigger className={button.Root} action="reset">
        <RotateCcwIcon /> Reset
      </Timer.ActionTrigger>
    </Timer.Control>
  </Timer.Root>
)

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Timer } from '@ark-ui/solid/timer'
import { PauseIcon, PlayIcon, RotateCcwIcon } from 'lucide-solid'

export const Interval = () => (
  <Timer.Root class="stack" interval={100} targetMs={60 * 1000}>
    <Timer.Area class={styles.Area}>
      <div class={styles.ItemGroup}>
        <Timer.Item class={styles.Item} type="seconds" />

### Events

The Timer component provides events that you can listen to for various timer-related actions.

- The `onComplete` event is triggered when the timer reaches its target time.
- The `onTick` event is called on each timer update, providing details about the current timer state.

**Example: events**

#### React

```tsx
import { Timer } from '@ark-ui/react/timer'
import { PlayIcon, RotateCcwIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import { useState } from 'react'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/timer.module.css'

export const Events = () => {
  const [ticks, setTicks] = useState(0)

  return (
    <Timer.Root
      className="stack"
      targetMs={60 * 1000}
      onComplete={() => console.log('Timer completed')}
      onTick={() => setTicks((t) => t + 1)}
    >
      <Timer.Area className={styles.Area}>
        <div className={styles.ItemGroup}>
          <Timer.Item className={styles.Item} type="minutes" />
          <span className={styles.ItemLabel}>minutes</span>
        </div>
        <Timer.Separator className={styles.Separator}>:</Timer.Separator>
        <div className={styles.ItemGroup}>
          <Timer.Item className={styles.Item} type="seconds" />
          <span className={styles.ItemLabel}>seconds</span>
        </div>
      </Timer.Area>

      <Timer.Control className="hstack">
        <Timer.ActionTrigger className={button.Root} action="start">
          <PlayIcon /> Start
        </Timer.ActionTrigger>
        <Timer.ActionTrigger className={button.Root} action="reset">
          <RotateCcwIcon /> Reset
        </Timer.ActionTrigger>
      </Timer.Control>

      <output>Ticks: {ticks}</output>
    </Timer.Root>
  )
}

```

import { PlayIcon, RotateCcwIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { createSignal } from 'solid-js'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'

export const Events = () => {
  const [ticks, setTicks] = createSignal(0)

  return (

### Pomodoro

Here's an example of building a pomodoro timer that alternates between work and break sessions:

**Example: pomodoro**

#### React

```tsx
import { Timer } from '@ark-ui/react/timer'
import { PauseIcon, PlayIcon, RotateCcwIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import { useState } from 'react'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/timer.module.css'

export const Pomodoro = () => {
  const [isWorking, setIsWorking] = useState(true)
  const [cycles, setCycles] = useState(0)

  const handleComplete = () => {
    setIsWorking(!isWorking)
    if (!isWorking) setCycles((c) => c + 1)
  }

  return (
    <Timer.Root
      className="stack"
      startMs={isWorking ? 25 * 60 * 1000 : 5 * 60 * 1000}
      countdown
      onComplete={handleComplete}
    >
      <h2>{isWorking ? 'Work Session' : 'Break Session'}</h2>

      <Timer.Area className={styles.Area}>
        <div className={styles.ItemGroup}>
          <Timer.Item className={styles.Item} type="minutes" />
          <span className={styles.ItemLabel}>minutes</span>
        </div>
        <Timer.Separator className={styles.Separator}>:</Timer.Separator>
        <div className={styles.ItemGroup}>
          <Timer.Item className={styles.Item} type="seconds" />
          <span className={styles.ItemLabel}>seconds</span>
        </div>
      </Timer.Area>

      <Timer.Control className="hstack">
        <Timer.ActionTrigger className={button.Root} action="start">
          <PlayIcon /> Start
        </Timer.ActionTrigger>
        <Timer.ActionTrigger className={button.Root} action="pause">
          <PauseIcon /> Pause
        </Timer.ActionTrigger>
        <Timer.ActionTrigger className={button.Root} action="reset">
          <RotateCcwIcon /> Reset
        </Timer.ActionTrigger>
      </Timer.Control>

      <output>Completed cycles: {cycles}</output>
    </Timer.Root>
  )
}

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Timer } from '@ark-ui/solid/timer'
import { PauseIcon, PlayIcon, RotateCcwIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { createSignal } from 'solid-js'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/timer.module.css'

export const Pomodoro = () => {
  const [isWorking, setIsWorking] = createSignal(true)
  const [cycles, setCycles] = createSignal(0)

  const handleComplete = () => {
    setIsWorking(!isWorking())
    if (!isWorking()) setCycles((c) => c + 1)
  }

  return (
    <Timer.Root
      class="stack"
      startMs={isWorking() ? 25 * 60 * 1000 : 5 * 60 * 1000}
      countdown
      onComplete={handleComplete}
    >
      <h2>{isWorking() ? 'Work Session' : 'Break Session'}</h2>

      <Timer.Area class={styles.Area}>
        <div class={styles.ItemGroup}>

        <Timer.ActionTrigger class={button.Root} action="pause">
          <PauseIcon /> Pause
        </Timer.ActionTrigger>
        <Timer.ActionTrigger class={button.Root} action="reset">
          <RotateCcwIcon /> Reset
        </Timer.ActionTrigger>
      </Timer.Control>

      <output>Completed cycles: {cycles()}</output>
    </Timer.Root>
  )
}

```

  </Timer.Control>

  <output>Completed cycles: {cycles}</output>
</Timer.Root>

```

### Root Provider

An alternative way to control the timer is to use the `RootProvider` component and the `useTimer` hook. This way you can
access the state and methods from outside the component.

**Example: root-provider**

#### React

```tsx
import { Timer, useTimer } from '@ark-ui/react/timer'
import { PauseIcon, PlayIcon, RotateCcwIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/timer.module.css'

export const RootProvider = () => {
  const timer = useTimer({ targetMs: 60 * 60 * 1000 })

  return (
    <div className="stack">
      <output>timer: {JSON.stringify(timer.time)}</output>
      <Timer.RootProvider className={styles.Root} value={timer}>
        <Timer.Area className={styles.Area}>
          <div className={styles.ItemGroup}>
            <Timer.Item className={styles.Item} type="hours" />
            <span className={styles.ItemLabel}>hours</span>
          </div>
          <Timer.Separator className={styles.Separator}>:</Timer.Separator>
          <div className={styles.ItemGroup}>
            <Timer.Item className={styles.Item} type="minutes" />
            <span className={styles.ItemLabel}>minutes</span>
          </div>
          <Timer.Separator className={styles.Separator}>:</Timer.Separator>
          <div className={styles.ItemGroup}>
            <Timer.Item className={styles.Item} type="seconds" />
            <span className={styles.ItemLabel}>seconds</span>
          </div>
        </Timer.Area>
        <Timer.Control className="hstack">
          <Timer.ActionTrigger className={button.Root} action="start">
            <PlayIcon /> Start
          </Timer.ActionTrigger>
          <Timer.ActionTrigger className={button.Root} action="resume">
            <PlayIcon /> Resume
          </Timer.ActionTrigger>
          <Timer.ActionTrigger className={button.Root} action="pause">
            <PauseIcon /> Pause
          </Timer.ActionTrigger>
          <Timer.ActionTrigger className={button.Root} action="reset">
            <RotateCcwIcon /> Reset
          </Timer.ActionTrigger>
        </Timer.Control>
      </Timer.RootProvider>
    </div>
  )
}

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Timer, useTimer } from '@ark-ui/solid/timer'
import { PauseIcon, PlayIcon, RotateCcwIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/timer.module.css'

export const RootProvider = () => {
  const timer = useTimer({ targetMs: 60 * 60 * 1000 })

  return (
    <div class="stack">
      <output>timer: {JSON.stringify(timer().time)}</output>
      <Timer.RootProvider value={timer}>
        <Timer.Area class={styles.Area}>
          <div class={styles.ItemGroup}>
            <Timer.Item class={styles.Item} type="hours" />
            <span class={styles.ItemLabel}>hours</span>
          </div>
          <Timer.Separator class={styles.Separator}>:</Timer.Separator>
          <div class={styles.ItemGroup}>
            <Timer.Item class={styles.Item} type="minutes" />
            <span class={styles.ItemLabel}>minutes</span>
          </div>
          <Timer.Separator class={styles.Separator}>:</Timer.Separator>
          <div class={styles.ItemGroup}>
            <Timer.Item class={styles.Item} type="seconds" />
            <span class={styles.ItemLabel}>seconds</span>
          </div>
        </Timer.Area>
        <Timer.Control class="hstack">
          <Timer.ActionTrigger class={button.Root} action="start">
            <PlayIcon /> Start
          </Timer.ActionTrigger>
          <Timer.ActionTrigger class={button.Root} action="resume">

# Toast



## Anatomy



```tsx
const toaster = createToaster({ placement: 'bottom-end' })

<Toaster toaster={toaster}>
  {(toast) => (
    <Toast.Root>
      <Toast.Title />
      <Toast.Description />
      <Toast.ActionTrigger />
      <Toast.CloseTrigger />
    </Toast.Root>
  )}
</Toaster>
```

## Setup

To use the Toast component, create the toast engine using the `createToaster` function.

This function manages the placement and grouping of toasts, and provides a `toast` object needed to create toast
notification.

```ts
const toaster = createToaster({
  placement: 'bottom-end',
  overlap: true,
  gap: 24,
})
```

## Examples

Here's an example of creating a toast using the `toast.create` method.

**Example: basic**

#### React

```tsx
import { Portal } from '@ark-ui/react/portal'
import { Toast, Toaster, createToaster } from '@ark-ui/react/toast'
import { XIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/toast.module.css'

const toaster = createToaster({
  placement: 'bottom-end',
  overlap: true,
  gap: 24,
})

export const Basic = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <button
        type="button"
        className={button.Root}
        onClick={() =>
          toaster.create({
            title: 'Scheduled for tomorrow',
            description: 'Your meeting has been scheduled for tomorrow at 10am.',
            type: 'info',
          })
        }
      >
        Schedule meeting
      </button>
      <Portal>
        <Toaster toaster={toaster}>
          {(toast) => (
            <Toast.Root key={toast.id} className={styles.Root}>
              <Toast.Title className={styles.Title}>{toast.title}</Toast.Title>
              <Toast.Description className={styles.Description}>{toast.description}</Toast.Description>
              <Toast.CloseTrigger className={styles.CloseTrigger}>
                <XIcon />
              </Toast.CloseTrigger>
            </Toast.Root>
          )}
        </Toaster>
      </Portal>
    </div>
  )
}

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Portal } from 'solid-js/web'
import { Toast, Toaster, createToaster } from '@ark-ui/solid/toast'
import { XIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/toast.module.css'

export const Basic = () => {
  const toaster = createToaster({
    placement: 'bottom-end',
    overlap: true,
    gap: 24,
  })

  return (
    <div>
      <button
        type="button"
        class={button.Root}
        onClick={() =>
          toaster.create({
            title: 'Scheduled for tomorrow',
            description: 'Your meeting has been scheduled for tomorrow at 10am.',
            type: 'info',
          })
        }
      >
        Schedule meeting
      </button>
      <Portal>
        <Toaster toaster={toaster}>
          {(toast) => (
            <Toast.Root class={styles.Root}>
              <Toast.Title class={styles.Title}>{toast().title}</Toast.Title>
              <Toast.Description class={styles.Description}>{toast().description}</Toast.Description>
              <Toast.CloseTrigger class={styles.CloseTrigger}>
                <XIcon />
              </Toast.CloseTrigger>
            </Toast.Root>
          )}
        </Toaster>
      </Portal>
    </div>
  )
}

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Toast, Toaster, createToaster } from '@ark-ui/vue/toast'
import { X } from 'lucide-vue-next'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/toast.module.css'

const toaster = createToaster({
  placement: 'bottom-end',
  overlap: true,
  gap: 16,
})

const createToast = () => {
  toaster.create({
    title: 'Scheduled for tomorrow',
    description: 'Your meeting has been scheduled for tomorrow at 10am.',
    type: 'info',
  })
}
</script>

<template>
  <div>
    <button type="button" :class="button.Root" @click="createToast">Schedule meeting</button>
    <Teleport to="body">
      <Toaster :toaster="toaster" v-slot="toast">
        <Toast.Root :class="styles.Root">
          <Toast.Title :class="styles.Title">{{ toast.title }}</Toast.Title>

          </Toast.CloseTrigger>
        </Toast.Root>
      </Toaster>
    </Teleport>
  </div>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Portal } from '@ark-ui/svelte/portal'
  import { Toast, Toaster, createToaster } from '@ark-ui/svelte/toast'
  import { X } from 'lucide-svelte'
  import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
  import styles from 'styles/toast.module.css'

  const toaster = createToaster({
    placement: 'bottom-end',
    overlap: true,
    gap: 16,
  })

  function addToast() {
    toaster.create({
      title: 'Scheduled for tomorrow',
      description: 'Your meeting has been scheduled for tomorrow at 10am.',
      type: 'info',
    })
  }
</script>

<div>
  <button type="button" class={button.Root} onclick={addToast}>Schedule meeting</button>
  <Portal>
    <Toaster {toaster}>
      {#snippet children(toast)}
        <Toast.Root class={styles.Root}>
          <Toast.Title class={styles.Title}>{toast().title}</Toast.Title>
          <Toast.Description class={styles.Description}>{toast().description}</Toast.Description>
          <Toast.CloseTrigger class={styles.CloseTrigger}>
            <X />
          </Toast.CloseTrigger>
        </Toast.Root>
      {/snippet}
    </Toaster>
  </Portal>
</div>

```

### Types

You can create different types of toasts (`success`, `error`, `warning`, `info`) with appropriate styling. For example,
to create a success toast, you can do:

```ts
toaster.success({
  title: 'Success!',
  description: 'Your changes have been saved.',
})
```

### Promise

You can use `toaster.promise()` to automatically handle the different states of an asynchronous operation. It provides
options for the `success`, `error`, and `loading` states of the promise and will automatically update the toast when the
promise resolves or rejects.

**Example: promise-toast**

#### React

```tsx
import { Portal } from '@ark-ui/react/portal'
import { Toast, Toaster, createToaster } from '@ark-ui/react/toast'

const toaster = createToaster({
  overlap: true,
  placement: 'bottom-end',
  gap: 16,
})

const uploadFile = () => {
  return new Promise<void>((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      Math.random() > 0.5 ? resolve() : reject(new Error('Upload failed'))
    }, 2000)
  })
}

export const PromiseToast = () => {
  const handleUpload = async () => {
    toaster.promise(uploadFile, {
      loading: {
        title: 'Uploading file...',
        description: 'Please wait while we upload your document.',
      },
      success: {
        title: 'Upload complete',
        description: 'Your file has been uploaded successfully.',
      },
      error: {
        title: 'Upload failed',
        description: 'Could not upload the file. Please try again.',
      },

        return <CircleCheckIcon className={styles.Indicator} />
      case 'error':
        return <CircleAlertIcon className={styles.Indicator} />
      default:
        return null
    }
  }

  return (

### Update

To update a toast, use the `toast.update` method.

**Example: update**

#### React

```tsx
import { Portal } from '@ark-ui/react/portal'
import { Toast, Toaster, createToaster } from '@ark-ui/react/toast'
import { useRef } from 'react'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/toast.module.css'

const toaster = createToaster({
  placement: 'bottom-end',
  overlap: true,
  gap: 24,
})

export const Update = () => {
  const id = useRef<string>(undefined)

  const createToast = () => {
    id.current = toaster.create({
      title: 'Sending message...',
      description: 'Please wait while we deliver your message.',
      type: 'loading',
    })
  }

  const updateToast = () => {
    if (!id.current) {
      return
    }
    toaster.update(id.current, {
      title: 'Message sent',
      description: 'Your message has been delivered successfully.',
      type: 'success',
    })
  }

  return (
    <div className="hstack">
      <button type="button" className={button.Root} onClick={createToast}>
        Send message
      </button>
      <button type="button" className={button.Root} onClick={updateToast}>
        Mark as sent
      </button>
      <Portal>
        <Toaster toaster={toaster}>
          {(toast) => (

              <Toast.Description className={styles.Description}>{toast.description}</Toast.Description>
            </Toast.Root>
          )}

### Action

To add an action to a toast, use the `toast.action` property.

**Example: action**

#### React

```tsx
import { Portal } from '@ark-ui/react/portal'
import { Toast, Toaster, createToaster } from '@ark-ui/react/toast'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/toast.module.css'

const toaster = createToaster({
  placement: 'bottom-end',
  gap: 24,
})

export const Action = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <button
        type="button"
        className={button.Root}
        onClick={() =>
          toaster.create({
            title: 'Event has been created',
            description: 'We have sent you an email with the event details.',
            type: 'info',
            action: {
              label: 'Undo',
              onClick: () => {
                console.log('Undo')
              },
            },
          })
        }
      >
        Create event
      </button>
      <Portal>
        <Toaster toaster={toaster}>
          {(toast) => (
            <Toast.Root key={toast.id} className={styles.Root}>
              <Toast.Title className={styles.Title}>{toast.title}</Toast.Title>
              <Toast.Description className={styles.Description}>{toast.description}</Toast.Description>
              {toast.action && (
                <Toast.ActionTrigger className={styles.ActionTrigger}>{toast.action?.label}</Toast.ActionTrigger>
              )}
            </Toast.Root>
          )}
        </Toaster>
      </Portal>

### Duration

You can control how long a toast stays visible by setting a custom `duration` in milliseconds, or use `Infinity` to keep
it visible until manually dismissed.

**Example: duration**

#### React

```tsx
import { Portal } from '@ark-ui/react/portal'
import { Toast, Toaster, createToaster } from '@ark-ui/react/toast'
import { XIcon, ClockIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/toast.module.css'

const toaster = createToaster({
  overlap: true,
  placement: 'bottom-end',
  gap: 16,
})

const durations = [
  { label: '1s', value: 1000 },
  { label: '3s', value: 3000 },
  { label: '5s', value: 5000 },
  { label: '∞', value: Infinity },
]

export const Duration = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <div style={{ display: 'flex', flexWrap: 'wrap', gap: '8px' }}>
        {durations.map((duration) => (
          <button
            key={duration.label}
            type="button"
            className={button.Root}
            onClick={() =>
              toaster.create({
                title: 'Reminder set',
                description: `This notification will ${
                  duration.value === Infinity ? 'stay until dismissed' : `disappear in ${duration.label}`
                }.`,
                type: 'info',
                duration: duration.value,
              })
            }
          >
            {duration.label}
          </button>
        ))}
      </div>

### Max Visible

Set the `max` prop on the `createToaster` function to define the maximum number of toasts that can be rendered at any
one time. Any extra toasts will be queued and rendered when a toast has been dismissed.

**Example: max-toasts**

#### React

```tsx
import { Portal } from '@ark-ui/react/portal'
import { Toast, Toaster, createToaster } from '@ark-ui/react/toast'
import { XIcon, InfoIcon } from 'lucide-react'

import styles from 'styles/toast.module.css'

const toaster = createToaster({
  max: 3,
  overlap: true,
  placement: 'bottom-end',
  gap: 16,
})

### Placement

Configure where toasts appear on the screen using the `placement` option in `createToaster`. Options include
`top-start`, `top-end`, `bottom-start`, `bottom-end`, and more.

**Example: placement**

#### React

```tsx
import { Portal } from '@ark-ui/react/portal'
import { Toast, Toaster, createToaster } from '@ark-ui/react/toast'
import { XIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/toast.module.css'

const toaster = createToaster({
  placement: 'top-end',
  overlap: true,
  gap: 16,
})

export const Placement = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <button
        type="button"
        className={button.Root}
        onClick={() =>
          toaster.create({
            title: 'Notification',
            description: 'This toast appears at the top-right corner.',
            type: 'info',
          })
        }
      >
        Show toast (top-end)
      </button>
      <Portal>
        <Toaster toaster={toaster}>
          {(toast) => (
            <Toast.Root key={toast.id} className={styles.Root}>
              <Toast.Title className={styles.Title}>{toast.title}</Toast.Title>
              <Toast.Description className={styles.Description}>{toast.description}</Toast.Description>

## Guides

### Toast in Effects

When creating a toast inside React effects (like `useEffect`, `useLayoutEffect`, or event handlers that trigger during
render), you may encounter a "flushSync" warning. To avoid this, wrap the toast call in `queueMicrotask`:

```tsx
import { useEffect } from 'react'

export const EffectToast = () => {
  useEffect(() => {
    // ❌ This may cause flushSync warnings
    // toaster.create({ title: 'Effect triggered!' })

    // ✅ Wrap in queueMicrotask to avoid warnings
    queueMicrotask(() => {
      toaster.create({
        title: 'Effect triggered!',
        description: 'This toast was called safely from an effect',
        type: 'success',
      })
    })
  }, [])

  return <div>Component content</div>
}
```

This ensures the toast creation is deferred until after the current execution context, preventing React's concurrent
rendering warnings.

### Styling

There's a minimal styling required for the toast to work correctly.

#### Toast root

The toast root will be assigned these css properties at runtime:

- `--x` - The x position
- `--y` - The y position
- `--scale` - The scale
- `--z-index` - The z-index
- `--height` - The height
- `--opacity` - The opacity
- `--gap` - The gap between toasts

```css
[data-scope='toast'][data-part='root'] {
  translate: var(--x) var(--y);
  scale: var(--scale);
  z-index: var(--z-index);
  height: var(--height);
  opacity: var(--opacity);
  will-change: translate, opacity, scale;
  transition:
    translate 400ms,
    scale 400ms,
    opacity 400ms,
    height 400ms,
    box-shadow 200ms;
  transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.21, 1.02, 0.73, 1);

  &[data-state='closed'] {
    transition:
      translate 400ms,
      scale 400ms,
      opacity 200ms;
    transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.06, 0.71, 0.55, 1);
  }
}
```

#### Styling based on type

You can also style based on the `data-type` attribute.

```css
[data-scope='toast'][data-part='root'] {
  &[data-type='error'] {
    background: red;
    color: white;
  }

  &[data-type='info'] {
    background: blue;
    color: white;
  }

  &[data-type='warning'] {
    background: orange;
  }

  &[data-type='success'] {
    background: green;
    color: white;
  }
}
```

#### Mobile considerations

A very common use case is to adjust the toast width on mobile so it spans the full width of the screen.

```css
@media (max-width: 640px) {
  [data-scope='toast'][data-part='group'] {
    width: 100%;
  }

  [data-scope='toast'][data-part='root'] {
    inset-inline: 0;
    width: calc(100% - var(--gap) * 2);
  }
}
```

# Toggle



## Anatomy



```tsx
<Toggle.Root>
  <Toggle.Indicator />
</Toggle.Root>
```

## Examples

**Example: basic**

#### React

```tsx
import { Toggle } from '@ark-ui/react/toggle'
import { BoldIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import styles from 'styles/toggle.module.css'

export const Basic = () => {
  return (
    <Toggle.Root className={styles.Root}>
      <BoldIcon />
    </Toggle.Root>
  )
}

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Toggle } from '@ark-ui/solid/toggle'
import { BoldIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import styles from 'styles/toggle.module.css'

export const Basic = () => {
  return (
    <Toggle.Root class={styles.Root}>
      <BoldIcon />
    </Toggle.Root>
  )
}

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Toggle } from '@ark-ui/vue/toggle'
import { BoldIcon } from 'lucide-vue-next'
import styles from 'styles/toggle.module.css'
</script>

<template>
  <Toggle.Root :class="styles.Root">
    <BoldIcon />
  </Toggle.Root>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Toggle } from '@ark-ui/svelte/toggle'
  import { BoldIcon } from 'lucide-svelte'
  import styles from 'styles/toggle.module.css'
</script>

<Toggle.Root class={styles.Root}>
  <BoldIcon />
</Toggle.Root>

```

### Controlled

Use the `pressed` and `onPressedChange` props to control the toggle's state.

**Example: controlled**

#### React

```tsx
import { Toggle } from '@ark-ui/react/toggle'
import { HeartIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import { useState } from 'react'
import styles from 'styles/toggle.module.css'

export const Controlled = () => {
  const [pressed, setPressed] = useState(false)
  return (
    <Toggle.Root className={styles.Root} pressed={pressed} onPressedChange={setPressed}>
      <Toggle.Indicator className={styles.Indicator} fallback={<HeartIcon />}>
        <HeartIcon fill="currentColor" />
      </Toggle.Indicator>
    </Toggle.Root>
  )
}

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Toggle } from '@ark-ui/solid/toggle'
import { HeartIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { createSignal } from 'solid-js'
import styles from 'styles/toggle.module.css'

export const Controlled = () => {
  const [pressed, setPressed] = createSignal(false)
  return (
    <Toggle.Root class={styles.Root} pressed={pressed()} onPressedChange={setPressed}>
      <Toggle.Indicator class={styles.Indicator} fallback={<HeartIcon />}>
        <HeartIcon fill="currentColor" />
      </Toggle.Indicator>
    </Toggle.Root>
  )
}

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Toggle } from '@ark-ui/vue/toggle'
import { HeartIcon } from 'lucide-vue-next'
import { ref } from 'vue'
import styles from 'styles/toggle.module.css'

const pressed = ref(false)
</script>

<template>
  <Toggle.Root :class="styles.Root" v-model:pressed="pressed">
    <Toggle.Indicator :class="styles.Indicator">
      <template #fallback>
        <HeartIcon />
      </template>
      <HeartIcon fill="currentColor" />
    </Toggle.Indicator>
  </Toggle.Root>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Toggle } from '@ark-ui/svelte/toggle'
  import { HeartIcon } from 'lucide-svelte'
  import styles from 'styles/toggle.module.css'

  let pressed = $state(false)
</script>

<Toggle.Root class={styles.Root} bind:pressed>
  <Toggle.Indicator class={styles.Indicator}>
    {#snippet fallback()}
      <HeartIcon />
    {/snippet}
    <HeartIcon fill="currentColor" />
  </Toggle.Indicator>
</Toggle.Root>

```

### Disabled

Use the `disabled` prop to disable the toggle.

**Example: disabled**

#### React

```tsx
import { Toggle } from '@ark-ui/react/toggle'
import { BoldIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import styles from 'styles/toggle.module.css'

export const Disabled = () => {
  return (
    <Toggle.Root className={styles.Root} disabled>
      <BoldIcon />
    </Toggle.Root>
  )
}

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Toggle } from '@ark-ui/solid/toggle'
import { BoldIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import styles from 'styles/toggle.module.css'

export const Disabled = () => {
  return (
    <Toggle.Root class={styles.Root} disabled>
      <BoldIcon />
    </Toggle.Root>
  )
}

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Toggle } from '@ark-ui/vue/toggle'
import { BoldIcon } from 'lucide-vue-next'

<template>
  <Toggle.Root :class="styles.Root" disabled>
    <BoldIcon />
  </Toggle.Root>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Toggle } from '@ark-ui/svelte/toggle'
  import { BoldIcon } from 'lucide-svelte'
  import styles from 'styles/toggle.module.css'
</script>

<Toggle.Root class={styles.Root} disabled>
  <BoldIcon />
</Toggle.Root>

```

### Indicator

Use the `Toggle.Indicator` component to render different indicators based on the state of the toggle.

**Example: indicator**

#### React

```tsx
import { Toggle } from '@ark-ui/react/toggle'
import { HeartIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import styles from 'styles/toggle.module.css'

export const Indicator = () => {
  return (
    <Toggle.Root className={styles.Root}>
      <Toggle.Indicator className={styles.Indicator} fallback={<HeartIcon />}>
        <HeartIcon fill="currentColor" />
      </Toggle.Indicator>
    </Toggle.Root>
  )
}

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Toggle } from '@ark-ui/solid/toggle'
import { HeartIcon } from 'lucide-solid'

  <Toggle.Root :class="styles.Root">
    <Toggle.Indicator :class="styles.Indicator">
      <template #fallback>
        <HeartIcon />
      </template>
      <HeartIcon fill="currentColor" />
    </Toggle.Indicator>
  </Toggle.Root>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">

```

### Controlled

Use the `value` and `onValueChange` props to control the toggle group state.

**Example: controlled**

#### React

```tsx
import { ToggleGroup } from '@ark-ui/react/toggle-group'
import { AlignCenterIcon, AlignJustifyIcon, AlignLeftIcon, AlignRightIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import { useState } from 'react'
import styles from 'styles/toggle-group.module.css'

export const Controlled = () => {
  const [value, setValue] = useState(['left'])
  return (
    <ToggleGroup.Root value={value} onValueChange={(e) => setValue(e.value)} className={styles.Root}>
      <ToggleGroup.Item value="left" className={styles.Item}>
        <AlignLeftIcon />
      </ToggleGroup.Item>
      <ToggleGroup.Item value="center" className={styles.Item}>
        <AlignCenterIcon />
      </ToggleGroup.Item>
      <ToggleGroup.Item value="right" className={styles.Item}>
        <AlignRightIcon />
      </ToggleGroup.Item>
      <ToggleGroup.Item value="justify" className={styles.Item}>
        <AlignJustifyIcon />
      </ToggleGroup.Item>
    </ToggleGroup.Root>
  )
}

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { ToggleGroup } from '@ark-ui/solid/toggle-group'
import { AlignCenterIcon, AlignJustifyIcon, AlignLeftIcon, AlignRightIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { createSignal } from 'solid-js'
import styles from 'styles/toggle-group.module.css'

export const Controlled = () => {
  const [value, setValue] = createSignal(['left'])
  return (
    <ToggleGroup.Root value={value()} onValueChange={(e) => setValue(e.value)} class={styles.Root}>
      <ToggleGroup.Item value="left" class={styles.Item}>
        <AlignLeftIcon />
      </ToggleGroup.Item>
      <ToggleGroup.Item value="center" class={styles.Item}>
        <AlignCenterIcon />
      </ToggleGroup.Item>
      <ToggleGroup.Item value="right" class={styles.Item}>
        <AlignRightIcon />
      </ToggleGroup.Item>
      <ToggleGroup.Item value="justify" class={styles.Item}>
        <AlignJustifyIcon />
      </ToggleGroup.Item>
    </ToggleGroup.Root>
  )
}

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { ToggleGroup } from '@ark-ui/vue/toggle-group'
import { AlignCenterIcon, AlignJustifyIcon, AlignLeftIcon, AlignRightIcon } from 'lucide-vue-next'
import { ref } from 'vue'
import styles from 'styles/toggle-group.module.css'

const value = ref(['left'])
</script>

<template>
  <ToggleGroup.Root v-model:value="value" :class="styles.Root">
    <ToggleGroup.Item value="left" :class="styles.Item">
      <AlignLeftIcon />
    </ToggleGroup.Item>
    <ToggleGroup.Item value="center" :class="styles.Item">
      <AlignCenterIcon />
    </ToggleGroup.Item>
    <ToggleGroup.Item value="right" :class="styles.Item">
      <AlignRightIcon />
    </ToggleGroup.Item>
    <ToggleGroup.Item value="justify" :class="styles.Item">
      <AlignJustifyIcon />
    </ToggleGroup.Item>
  </ToggleGroup.Root>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { ToggleGroup } from '@ark-ui/svelte/toggle-group'
  import AlignCenterIcon from 'lucide-svelte/icons/align-center'
  import AlignJustifyIcon from 'lucide-svelte/icons/align-justify'
  import AlignLeftIcon from 'lucide-svelte/icons/align-left'
  import AlignRightIcon from 'lucide-svelte/icons/align-right'
  import styles from 'styles/toggle-group.module.css'

  let value = $state(['left'])
</script>

<ToggleGroup.Root bind:value class={styles.Root}>
  <ToggleGroup.Item value="left" class={styles.Item}>
    <AlignLeftIcon />
  </ToggleGroup.Item>
  <ToggleGroup.Item value="center" class={styles.Item}>
    <AlignCenterIcon />
  </ToggleGroup.Item>
  <ToggleGroup.Item value="right" class={styles.Item}>
    <AlignRightIcon />
  </ToggleGroup.Item>
  <ToggleGroup.Item value="justify" class={styles.Item}>
    <AlignJustifyIcon />
  </ToggleGroup.Item>
</ToggleGroup.Root>

```

### Root Provider

An alternative way to control the toggle group is to use the `RootProvider` component and the `useToggleGroup` hook.
This way you can access the state and methods from outside the component.

**Example: root-provider**

#### React

```tsx
import { ToggleGroup, useToggleGroup } from '@ark-ui/react/toggle-group'
import { AlignCenterIcon, AlignJustifyIcon, AlignLeftIcon, AlignRightIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import styles from 'styles/toggle-group.module.css'

export const RootProvider = () => {
  const toggleGroup = useToggleGroup({ defaultValue: ['left'] })

# Tooltip



## Anatomy



```tsx
<Tooltip.Root>
  <Tooltip.Trigger />
  <Tooltip.Positioner>
    <Tooltip.Arrow>
      <Tooltip.ArrowTip />
    </Tooltip.Arrow>
    <Tooltip.Content />
  </Tooltip.Positioner>
</Tooltip.Root>
```

## Examples

**Example: basic**

#### React

```tsx
import { Tooltip } from '@ark-ui/react/tooltip'
import { Portal } from '@ark-ui/react/portal'
import styles from 'styles/tooltip.module.css'

export const Basic = () => (
  <Tooltip.Root>
    <Tooltip.Trigger className={styles.Trigger}>Hover Me</Tooltip.Trigger>
    <Portal>
      <Tooltip.Positioner>
        <Tooltip.Content className={styles.Content}>I am a tooltip!</Tooltip.Content>
      </Tooltip.Positioner>
    </Portal>
  </Tooltip.Root>
)

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Tooltip } from '@ark-ui/solid/tooltip'
import { Portal } from 'solid-js/web'
import styles from 'styles/tooltip.module.css'

export const Basic = () => (
  <Tooltip.Root>
    <Tooltip.Trigger class={styles.Trigger}>Hover Me</Tooltip.Trigger>
    <Portal>
      <Tooltip.Positioner>
        <Tooltip.Content class={styles.Content}>I am a tooltip!</Tooltip.Content>
      </Tooltip.Positioner>
    </Portal>
  </Tooltip.Root>
)

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Tooltip } from '@ark-ui/vue/tooltip'
import styles from 'styles/tooltip.module.css'
</script>

<template>
  <Tooltip.Root>
    <Tooltip.Trigger :class="styles.Trigger">Hover Me</Tooltip.Trigger>
    <Teleport to="body">
      <Tooltip.Positioner>
        <Tooltip.Content :class="styles.Content">I am a tooltip!</Tooltip.Content>
      </Tooltip.Positioner>
    </Teleport>
  </Tooltip.Root>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Portal } from '@ark-ui/svelte/portal'
  import { Tooltip } from '@ark-ui/svelte/tooltip'
  import styles from 'styles/tooltip.module.css'
</script>

<Tooltip.Root>
  <Tooltip.Trigger class={styles.Trigger}>Hover Me</Tooltip.Trigger>
  <Portal>
    <Tooltip.Positioner>
      <Tooltip.Content class={styles.Content}>I am a tooltip!</Tooltip.Content>
    </Tooltip.Positioner>
  </Portal>
</Tooltip.Root>

```

### Controlled

To create a controlled Tooltip component, manage the state of whether the tooltip is open using the `open` prop:

**Example: controlled**

#### React

```tsx
import { Portal } from '@ark-ui/react/portal'
import { Tooltip } from '@ark-ui/react/tooltip'
import { useState } from 'react'
import styles from 'styles/tooltip.module.css'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'

export const Controlled = () => {
  const [open, setOpen] = useState(false)
  return (
    <div className="stack">
      <button type="button" onClick={() => setOpen(!open)} className={button.Root}>
        Toggle
      </button>
      <Tooltip.Root open={open} onOpenChange={(e) => setOpen(e.open)}>
        <Tooltip.Trigger className={styles.Trigger}>Hover Me</Tooltip.Trigger>
        <Portal>
          <Tooltip.Positioner>
            <Tooltip.Content className={styles.Content}>I am a tooltip!</Tooltip.Content>
          </Tooltip.Positioner>
        </Portal>
      </Tooltip.Root>
    </div>
  )
}

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Tooltip } from '@ark-ui/solid/tooltip'
import { createSignal } from 'solid-js'
import { Portal } from 'solid-js/web'
import styles from 'styles/tooltip.module.css'

export const Controlled = () => {
  const [open, setOpen] = createSignal(false)
  return (
    <>
      <button type="button" onClick={() => setOpen(!open())}>
        Toggle
      </button>
      <Tooltip.Root open={open()} onOpenChange={(e) => setOpen(e.open)}>
        <Tooltip.Trigger class={styles.Trigger}>Hover Me</Tooltip.Trigger>
        <Portal>
          <Tooltip.Positioner>
            <Tooltip.Content class={styles.Content}>I am a tooltip!</Tooltip.Content>
          </Tooltip.Positioner>
        </Portal>
      </Tooltip.Root>
    </>
  )
}

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Tooltip } from '@ark-ui/vue/tooltip'
import { ref } from 'vue'
import styles from 'styles/tooltip.module.css'

const open = ref(false)
</script>

<template>
  <button @click="open = !open">Toggle</button>
  <Tooltip.Root v-model:open="open">
    <Tooltip.Trigger :class="styles.Trigger">Hover Me</Tooltip.Trigger>
    <Teleport to="body">
      <Tooltip.Positioner>
        <Tooltip.Content :class="styles.Content">I am a tooltip!</Tooltip.Content>
      </Tooltip.Positioner>
    </Teleport>
  </Tooltip.Root>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Portal } from '@ark-ui/svelte/portal'
  import { Tooltip } from '@ark-ui/svelte/tooltip'
  import styles from 'styles/tooltip.module.css'

  let open = $state(false)
</script>

<button onclick={() => (open = !open)}>Toggle</button>

<Tooltip.Root bind:open>
  <Tooltip.Trigger class={styles.Trigger}>Hover Me</Tooltip.Trigger>
  <Portal>
    <Tooltip.Positioner>
      <Tooltip.Content class={styles.Content}>I am a tooltip!</Tooltip.Content>
    </Tooltip.Positioner>
  </Portal>
</Tooltip.Root>

```

### Root Provider

An alternative way to control the tooltip is to use the `RootProvider` component and the `useTooltip` hook. This way you
can access the state and methods from outside the component.

**Example: root-provider**

#### React

```tsx
import { Tooltip, useTooltip } from '@ark-ui/react/tooltip'
import { Portal } from '@ark-ui/react/portal'
import styles from 'styles/tooltip.module.css'

export const RootProvider = () => {
  const tooltip = useTooltip()

  return (
    <>
      <output>Open: {String(tooltip.open)}</output>
      <Tooltip.RootProvider value={tooltip}>
        <Tooltip.Trigger className={styles.Trigger}>Hover Me</Tooltip.Trigger>
        <Portal>
          <Tooltip.Positioner>
            <Tooltip.Content className={styles.Content}>I am a tooltip!</Tooltip.Content>
          </Tooltip.Positioner>
        </Portal>
      </Tooltip.RootProvider>
    </>
  )
}

```

**Example: arrow**

#### React

```tsx
import { Tooltip } from '@ark-ui/react/tooltip'
import { Portal } from '@zag-js/react'
import styles from 'styles/tooltip.module.css'

export const Arrow = () => (
  <Tooltip.Root>
    <Tooltip.Trigger className={styles.Trigger}>Hover Me</Tooltip.Trigger>
    <Portal>
      <Tooltip.Positioner>
        <Tooltip.Content className={styles.Content}>
          <Tooltip.Arrow className={styles.Arrow}>
            <Tooltip.ArrowTip className={styles.ArrowTip} />
          </Tooltip.Arrow>
          I am a tooltip!
        </Tooltip.Content>
      </Tooltip.Positioner>
    </Portal>

      <Tooltip.Positioner>
        <Tooltip.Content class={styles.Content}>
          <Tooltip.Arrow class={styles.Arrow}>
            <Tooltip.ArrowTip class={styles.ArrowTip} />
          </Tooltip.Arrow>
          I am a tooltip!
        </Tooltip.Content>
      </Tooltip.Positioner>
    </Portal>
  </Tooltip.Root>

</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Portal } from '@ark-ui/svelte/portal'
  import { Tooltip } from '@ark-ui/svelte/tooltip'
  import styles from 'styles/tooltip.module.css'
</script>

<Tooltip.Root>
  <Tooltip.Trigger class={styles.Trigger}>Hover Me</Tooltip.Trigger>
  <Portal>
    <Tooltip.Positioner>
      <Tooltip.Content class={styles.Content}>

        I am a tooltip!
      </Tooltip.Content>
    </Tooltip.Positioner>
  </Portal>
</Tooltip.Root>

```

### Delay

To configure the open and close delay for the Tooltip, use the `closeDelay` and `openDelay` props:

**Example: delay**

#### React

```tsx
import { Tooltip } from '@ark-ui/react/tooltip'
import { Portal } from '@ark-ui/react/portal'
import styles from 'styles/tooltip.module.css'

export const Delay = () => (
  <Tooltip.Root closeDelay={0} openDelay={0}>
    <Tooltip.Trigger className={styles.Trigger}>Hover Me</Tooltip.Trigger>
    <Portal>
      <Tooltip.Positioner>
        <Tooltip.Content className={styles.Content}>I am a tooltip!</Tooltip.Content>
      </Tooltip.Positioner>
    </Portal>
  </Tooltip.Root>
)

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Tooltip } from '@ark-ui/solid/tooltip'
import { Portal } from 'solid-js/web'
import styles from 'styles/tooltip.module.css'

export const Delay = () => (
  <Tooltip.Root closeDelay={0} openDelay={0}>
    <Tooltip.Trigger class={styles.Trigger}>Hover Me</Tooltip.Trigger>
    <Portal>
      <Tooltip.Positioner>
        <Tooltip.Content class={styles.Content}>I am a tooltip!</Tooltip.Content>
      </Tooltip.Positioner>
    </Portal>
  </Tooltip.Root>
)

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Tooltip } from '@ark-ui/vue/tooltip'
import styles from 'styles/tooltip.module.css'
</script>

<template>
  <Tooltip.Root :closeDelay="0" :openDelay="0">
    <Tooltip.Trigger :class="styles.Trigger">Hover Me</Tooltip.Trigger>
    <Teleport to="body">
      <Tooltip.Positioner>
        <Tooltip.Content :class="styles.Content">I am a tooltip!</Tooltip.Content>
      </Tooltip.Positioner>
    </Teleport>
  </Tooltip.Root>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Portal } from '@ark-ui/svelte/portal'
  import { Tooltip } from '@ark-ui/svelte/tooltip'
  import styles from 'styles/tooltip.module.css'
</script>

<Tooltip.Root closeDelay={0} openDelay={0}>
  <Tooltip.Trigger class={styles.Trigger}>Hover Me</Tooltip.Trigger>
  <Portal>
    <Tooltip.Positioner>
      <Tooltip.Content class={styles.Content}>I am a tooltip!</Tooltip.Content>
    </Tooltip.Positioner>
  </Portal>
</Tooltip.Root>

```

### Positioning

To customize the position of the Tooltip relative to the trigger, use the `positioning` prop:

**Example: positioning**

#### React

```tsx
import { Tooltip } from '@ark-ui/react/tooltip'
import { Portal } from '@ark-ui/react/portal'
import styles from 'styles/tooltip.module.css'

export const Positioning = () => (
  <Tooltip.Root
    positioning={{
      placement: 'left-start',
      offset: { mainAxis: 12, crossAxis: 12 },
    }}
  >
    <Tooltip.Trigger className={styles.Trigger}>Hover Me</Tooltip.Trigger>
    <Portal>
      <Tooltip.Positioner>
        <Tooltip.Content className={styles.Content}>I am a tooltip!</Tooltip.Content>
      </Tooltip.Positioner>
    </Portal>
  </Tooltip.Root>
)

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Tooltip } from '@ark-ui/solid/tooltip'
import { Portal } from 'solid-js/web'
import styles from 'styles/tooltip.module.css'

export const Positioning = () => (
  <Tooltip.Root
    positioning={{
      placement: 'left-start',
      offset: { mainAxis: 12, crossAxis: 12 },
    }}
  >
    <Tooltip.Trigger class={styles.Trigger}>Hover Me</Tooltip.Trigger>
    <Portal>
      <Tooltip.Positioner>
        <Tooltip.Content class={styles.Content}>I am a tooltip!</Tooltip.Content>
      </Tooltip.Positioner>
    </Portal>
  </Tooltip.Root>
)

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Tooltip } from '@ark-ui/vue/tooltip'
import styles from 'styles/tooltip.module.css'
</script>

<template>
  <Tooltip.Root
    :positioning="{
      placement: 'left-start',
      offset: { mainAxis: 12, crossAxis: 12 },
    }"
  >
    <Tooltip.Trigger :class="styles.Trigger">Hover Me</Tooltip.Trigger>
    <Teleport to="body">
      <Tooltip.Positioner>
        <Tooltip.Content :class="styles.Content">I am a tooltip!</Tooltip.Content>
      </Tooltip.Positioner>
    </Teleport>
  </Tooltip.Root>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Portal } from '@ark-ui/svelte/portal'
  import { Tooltip } from '@ark-ui/svelte/tooltip'
  import styles from 'styles/tooltip.module.css'
</script>

<Tooltip.Root positioning={{ placement: 'left-start', offset: { mainAxis: 12, crossAxis: 12 } }}>
  <Tooltip.Trigger class={styles.Trigger}>Hover Me</Tooltip.Trigger>
  <Portal>
    <Tooltip.Positioner>
      <Tooltip.Content class={styles.Content}>I am a tooltip!</Tooltip.Content>
    </Tooltip.Positioner>
  </Portal>
</Tooltip.Root>

```

### Context

For more control over the Tooltip's functionality, you can use `Tooltip.Context` to access the Tooltip API:

**Example: context**

#### React

```tsx
import { Portal } from '@ark-ui/react/portal'
import { Tooltip } from '@ark-ui/react/tooltip'
import styles from 'styles/tooltip.module.css'

export const Context = () => (
  <Tooltip.Root>
    <Tooltip.Trigger className={styles.Trigger}>Hover Me</Tooltip.Trigger>
    <Portal>
      <Tooltip.Positioner>
        <Tooltip.Context>
          {(tooltip) => (
            <Tooltip.Content className={styles.Content}>
              This tooltip is open: {tooltip.open.toString()}
            </Tooltip.Content>
          )}
        </Tooltip.Context>
      </Tooltip.Positioner>
    </Portal>
  </Tooltip.Root>
)

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Tooltip } from '@ark-ui/solid/tooltip'
import { Portal } from 'solid-js/web'
import styles from 'styles/tooltip.module.css'

export const Context = () => (
  <Tooltip.Root>
    <Tooltip.Trigger class={styles.Trigger}>Hover Me</Tooltip.Trigger>
    <Portal>
      <Tooltip.Positioner>
        <Tooltip.Context>
          {(context) => (
            <Tooltip.Content class={styles.Content}>This tooltip is open: {context().open.toString()}</Tooltip.Content>
          )}
        </Tooltip.Context>
      </Tooltip.Positioner>
    </Portal>
  </Tooltip.Root>
)

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Tooltip } from '@ark-ui/vue/tooltip'
import styles from 'styles/tooltip.module.css'
</script>

<template>
  <Tooltip.Root>
    <Tooltip.Trigger :class="styles.Trigger">Hover Me</Tooltip.Trigger>
    <Teleport to="body">
      <Tooltip.Positioner>
        <Tooltip.Context v-slot="tooltip">
          <Tooltip.Content :class="styles.Content">This tooltip is open: {{ tooltip.open.toString() }}</Tooltip.Content>
        </Tooltip.Context>
      </Tooltip.Positioner>
    </Teleport>
  </Tooltip.Root>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Portal } from '@ark-ui/svelte/portal'
  import { Tooltip } from '@ark-ui/svelte/tooltip'
  import styles from 'styles/tooltip.module.css'
</script>

<Tooltip.Root>
  <Tooltip.Trigger class={styles.Trigger}>Hover Me</Tooltip.Trigger>
  <Portal>
    <Tooltip.Positioner>
      <Tooltip.Context>
        {#snippet render(context)}
          <Tooltip.Content class={styles.Content}>
            This tooltip is open: {context().open.toString()}
          </Tooltip.Content>
        {/snippet}
      </Tooltip.Context>
    </Tooltip.Positioner>
  </Portal>
</Tooltip.Root>

```

### Within Fixed Containers

When rendering a tooltip inside a fixed-position container, set `positioning.strategy` to `"fixed"` to ensure proper
positioning.

**Example: within-fixed**

#### React

```tsx
import { Portal } from '@ark-ui/react/portal'
import { Tooltip } from '@ark-ui/react/tooltip'
import styles from 'styles/tooltip.module.css'

export const WithinFixed = () => (
  <div style={{ position: 'fixed', top: '40px', left: '40px', padding: '40px', background: 'red' }}>
    <Tooltip.Root positioning={{ strategy: 'fixed' }}>
      <Tooltip.Trigger className={styles.Trigger}>Hover Me</Tooltip.Trigger>
      <Portal>
        <Tooltip.Positioner>
          <Tooltip.Content className={styles.Content}>I am a tooltip!</Tooltip.Content>
        </Tooltip.Positioner>
      </Portal>
    </Tooltip.Root>
  </div>
)

```

### Step Types

Demonstrate all three step types in a single tour: `dialog` for welcome/completion, `tooltip` anchored to elements, and
`floating` for fixed-position content.

### Async

Load data asynchronously and update step content before displaying it using the `effect` function with `show()` and
`update()`.

**Example: async-step**

## Guides

### Step Types

The tour machine supports different types of steps, allowing you to create a diverse and interactive tour experience.
The available step types are defined in the `StepType` type:

- `tooltip`: Displays the step content as a tooltip, typically positioned near the target element.

- `dialog`: Shows the step content in a modal dialog centered on screen, useful for starting or ending the tour. This
  usually don't have a `target` defined.

- `floating`: Presents the step content as a floating element, which can be positioned flexibly on the screen. This
  usually don't have a `target` defined.

- `wait`: A special type that waits for a specific condition before proceeding to the next step.

```tsx
const steps: TourStepDetails[] = [
  {
    id: 'step-1',
    type: 'tooltip',
    placement: 'top-start',
    target: () => document.querySelector('#target-1'),
    title: 'Tooltip Step',
    description: 'This is a tooltip step',
  },
  {
    id: 'step-2',
    type: 'dialog',
    title: 'Dialog Step',
    description: 'This is a dialog step',
  },
  {
    id: 'step-3',
    type: 'floating',
    placement: 'top-start',
    title: 'Floating Step',
    description: 'This is a floating step',
  },
  {
    id: 'step-4',
    type: 'wait',
    title: 'Wait Step',
    description: 'This is a wait step',
    effect({ next }) {
      // do something and go next
      // you can also return a cleanup
    },
  },
]
```

### Actions

Every step supports a list of actions that are rendered in the step footer.Use the `actions` property to define each
action.

```tsx
const steps: TourStepDetails[] = [
  {
    id: 'step-1',
    type: 'dialog',
    title: 'Dialog Step',
    description: 'This is a dialog step',
    actions: [{ label: 'Show me a tour!', action: 'next' }],
  },
]
```

### Tooltip Placement

Use the `placement` property to define the placement of the tooltip.

```tsx {5}
const steps: TourStepDetails[] = [
  {
    id: 'step-1',
    type: 'tooltip',
    placement: 'top-start',
    // ...
  },
]
```

### Hide Arrow

Set `arrow: false` in the step property to hide the tooltip arrow. This is only useful for tooltip steps.

```tsx {5}
const steps: TourStepDetails[] = [
  {
    id: 'step-1',
    type: 'tooltip',
    arrow: false,
  },
]
```

### Hide Backdrop

Set `backdrop: false` in the step property to hide the backdrop. This applies to all step types except the `wait` step.

```tsx {5}
const steps: TourStepDetails[] = [
  {
    id: 'step-1',
    type: 'dialog',
    backdrop: false,
  },
]
```

### Effects

Step effects are functions that are called before a step is opened. They are useful for adding custom logic to a step.

This function provides the following methods:

- `next()`: Call this method to move to the next step.
- `show()`: Call this method to show the current step.
- `update(details: StepDetails)`: Call this method to update the details of the current step (say, after data has been
  fetched).

```tsx
const steps: TourStepDetails[] = [
  {
    id: 'step-1',
    type: 'tooltip',
    effect({ next, show, update }) {
      fetchData().then((res) => {
        // update the step details
        update({ title: res.title })
        // then show show the step
        show()
      })

      return () => {
        // cleanup fetch data
      }
    },
  },
]
```

### Wait

Wait steps are useful when you need to wait for a specific condition before proceeding to the next step.

Use the step `effect` function to perform an action and then call `next()` to move to the next step.

> **Note:** You cannot call `show()` in a wait step.

```tsx
const steps: TourStepDetails[] = [
  {
    id: 'step-1',
    type: 'wait',
    effect({ next }) {
      const button = document.querySelector('#button')
      const listener = () => next()
      button.addEventListener('click', listener)
      return () => button.removeEventListener('click', listener)
    },
  },
]
```

### Styling

Ensure the `box-sizing` is set to `border-box` for the means of measuring the tour target.

```css
* {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

Ensure the `body` has a `position` of `relative`.

```css
body {
  position: relative;
}
```

### Root Provider

An alternative way to control the tree view is to use the `RootProvider` component and the `useTreeView` hook. This way
you can access the state and methods from outside the component.

**Example: root-provider**

#### React

```tsx
import { TreeView, createTreeCollection, useTreeView } from '@ark-ui/react/tree-view'
import { ChevronRightIcon, FileIcon, FolderIcon, FolderOpenIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import styles from 'styles/tree-view.module.css'

export const RootProvider = () => {
  const treeView = useTreeView({ collection })

  return (
    <div className="stack">
      <output>selected: {JSON.stringify(treeView.selectedValue)}</output>
      <TreeView.RootProvider className={styles.Root} value={treeView}>
        <TreeView.Label className={styles.Label}>Tree</TreeView.Label>
        <TreeView.Tree className={styles.Tree}>
          {collection.rootNode.children?.map((node, index) => (
            <TreeNode key={node.id} node={node} indexPath={[index]} />
          ))}
        </TreeView.Tree>
      </TreeView.RootProvider>
    </div>
  )
}

const TreeNode = (props: TreeView.NodeProviderProps<Node>) => {
  const { node, indexPath } = props
  return (
    <TreeView.NodeProvider key={node.id} node={node} indexPath={indexPath}>
      <TreeView.NodeContext>
        {(nodeState) =>
          node.children ? (
            <TreeView.Branch className={styles.Branch}>
              <TreeView.BranchControl className={styles.BranchControl}>
                <TreeView.BranchIndicator className={styles.BranchIndicator}>
                  <ChevronRightIcon />
                </TreeView.BranchIndicator>
                <TreeView.BranchText className={styles.BranchText}>
                  {nodeState.expanded ? <FolderOpenIcon /> : <FolderIcon />}
                  {node.name}
                </TreeView.BranchText>
              </TreeView.BranchControl>
              <TreeView.BranchContent className={styles.BranchContent}>
                <TreeView.BranchIndentGuide className={styles.BranchIndentGuide} />
                {node.children.map((child, index) => (
                  <TreeNode key={child.id} node={child} indexPath={[...indexPath, index]} />
                ))}
              </TreeView.BranchContent>
            </TreeView.Branch>
          ) : (
            <TreeView.Item className={styles.Item}>
              <TreeView.ItemText className={styles.ItemText}>
                <FileIcon />
                {node.name}
              </TreeView.ItemText>
            </TreeView.Item>
          )
        }
      </TreeView.NodeContext>
    </TreeView.NodeProvider>
  )
}

interface Node {
  id: string
  name: string
  children?: Node[] | undefined
}

const collection = createTreeCollection<Node>({
  nodeToValue: (node) => node.id,
  nodeToString: (node) => node.name,
  rootNode: {
    id: 'ROOT',
    name: '',
    children: [
      {
        id: 'node_modules',
        name: 'node_modules',

          { id: 'node_modules/pandacss', name: 'panda' },
          {

### Lazy Loading

Lazy loading is a feature that allows the tree view to load children of a node on demand (or async). This helps to
improve the initial load time and memory usage.

To use this, you need to provide the following:

- `loadChildren` — A function that is used to load the children of a node.
- `onLoadChildrenComplete` — A callback that is called when the children of a node are loaded. Used to update the tree
  collection.
- `childrenCount` — A number that indicates the number of children of a branch node.

**Example: async-loading**

### Lazy Mount

Lazy mounting is a feature that allows the content of a tree view to be rendered only when it is expanded. This is
useful for performance optimization, especially when tree content is large or complex. To enable lazy mounting, use the
`lazyMount` prop on the `TreeView.Root` component.

In addition, the `unmountOnExit` prop can be used in conjunction with `lazyMount` to unmount the tree view content when
branches are collapsed, freeing up resources. The next time a branch is expanded, its content will be re-rendered.

**Example: lazy-mount**

### Filtering

Filtering is useful when you have a large tree and you want to filter the nodes to only show the ones that match the
search query. Here's an example that composes the `filter` method from the `TreeCollection` and `useFilter` hook to
filter the nodes.

**Example: filtering**

#### React

```tsx
import { useFilter } from '@ark-ui/react/locale'
import { TreeView, createTreeCollection, useTreeViewContext } from '@ark-ui/react/tree-view'
import { ChevronRightIcon, FileIcon, FolderIcon, FolderOpenIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import { useState } from 'react'
import styles from 'styles/tree-view.module.css'
import fieldStyles from 'styles/field.module.css'

export const Filtering = () => {
  const { contains } = useFilter({ sensitivity: 'base' })
  const [collection, setCollection] = useState(initialCollection)

  const filter = (value: string) => {
    const filtered =
      value.length > 0 ? initialCollection.filter((node) => contains(node.name, value)) : initialCollection
    setCollection(filtered)
  }

  return (
    <div className="stack" style={{ maxWidth: '20rem' }}>
      <input className={fieldStyles.Input} placeholder="Search" onChange={(e) => filter(e.target.value)} />
      <TreeView.Root className={styles.Root} collection={collection}>
        <TreeView.Tree className={styles.Tree}>
          {collection.rootNode.children?.map((node, index) => (
            <TreeNode key={node.id} node={node} indexPath={[index]} />
          ))}
        </TreeView.Tree>
      </TreeView.Root>
    </div>
  )
}

const TreeNode = (props: TreeView.NodeProviderProps<Node>) => {
  const { node, indexPath } = props
  const tree = useTreeViewContext()
  const nodeState = tree.getNodeState(props)
  return (
    <TreeView.NodeProvider key={node.id} node={node} indexPath={indexPath}>
      {nodeState.isBranch ? (
        <TreeView.Branch className={styles.Branch}>
          <TreeView.BranchControl className={styles.BranchControl}>
            <TreeView.BranchIndicator className={styles.BranchIndicator}>
              <ChevronRightIcon />
            </TreeView.BranchIndicator>
            <TreeView.BranchText className={styles.BranchText}>
              {nodeState.expanded ? <FolderOpenIcon /> : <FolderIcon />} {node.name}
            </TreeView.BranchText>
          </TreeView.BranchControl>
          <TreeView.BranchContent className={styles.BranchContent}>
            <TreeView.BranchIndentGuide className={styles.BranchIndentGuide} />
            {node.children?.map((child, index) => (
              <TreeNode key={child.id} node={child} indexPath={[...indexPath, index]} />
            ))}
          </TreeView.BranchContent>
        </TreeView.Branch>
      ) : (
        <TreeView.Item className={styles.Item}>
          <TreeView.ItemText className={styles.ItemText}>
            <FileIcon />
            {node.name}
          </TreeView.ItemText>
        </TreeView.Item>
      )}
    </TreeView.NodeProvider>
  )
}

interface Node {
  id: string
  name: string
  children?: Node[]
}

const initialCollection = createTreeCollection<Node>({
  nodeToValue: (node) => node.id,
  nodeToString: (node) => node.name,
  rootNode: {
    id: 'ROOT',
    name: '',
    children: [
      {
        id: 'node_modules',
        name: 'node_modules',
        children: [
          { id: 'node_modules/zag-js', name: 'zag-js' },
          { id: 'node_modules/pandacss', name: 'panda' },
          {
            id: 'node_modules/@types',
            name: '@types',
            children: [
              { id: 'node_modules/@types/react', name: 'react' },
              { id: 'node_modules/@types/react-dom', name: 'react-dom' },
            ],
          },
        ],

### Links

Tree items can be rendered as links to another page or website. This could be useful for documentation sites.

Here's an example that modifies the tree collection to represent an hierarchical link structure. It uses the `asChild`
prop to render the tree items as links, passing the `href` prop to a `<a>` element.

**Example: links**

#### React

```tsx
import { TreeView, createTreeCollection } from '@ark-ui/react/tree-view'
import { ChevronRightIcon, ExternalLinkIcon, FileIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import styles from 'styles/tree-view.module.css'

export const Links = () => {
  return (
    <TreeView.Root className={styles.Root} collection={collection}>
      <TreeView.Label className={styles.Label}>Docs</TreeView.Label>
      <TreeView.Tree className={styles.Tree}>
        {collection.rootNode.children?.map((node, index) => (
          <TreeNode key={node.id} node={node} indexPath={[index]} />
        ))}
      </TreeView.Tree>
    </TreeView.Root>
  )
}

const TreeNode = (props: TreeView.NodeProviderProps<Node>) => {
  const { node, indexPath } = props
  return (
    <TreeView.NodeProvider key={node.id} node={node} indexPath={indexPath}>
      {node.children ? (
        <TreeView.Branch className={styles.Branch}>
          <TreeView.BranchControl className={styles.BranchControl}>
            <TreeView.BranchIndicator className={styles.BranchIndicator}>
              <ChevronRightIcon />
            </TreeView.BranchIndicator>
            <TreeView.BranchText className={styles.BranchText}>{node.name}</TreeView.BranchText>
          </TreeView.BranchControl>
          <TreeView.BranchContent className={styles.BranchContent}>
            <TreeView.BranchIndentGuide className={styles.BranchIndentGuide} />
            {node.children.map((child, index) => (
              <TreeNode key={child.id} node={child} indexPath={[...indexPath, index]} />
            ))}
          </TreeView.BranchContent>
        </TreeView.Branch>
      ) : (
        <TreeView.Item className={styles.Item} asChild>
          <a href={node.href}>
            <TreeView.ItemText className={styles.ItemText}>
              <FileIcon />
              {node.name}
            </TreeView.ItemText>
            {node.href?.startsWith('http') && <ExternalLinkIcon size={12} />}
          </a>
        </TreeView.Item>
      )}
    </TreeView.NodeProvider>
  )
}

### Virtualized

For large tree views with thousands of nodes, virtualization can significantly improve performance by only rendering
visible nodes.

Key implementation details:

- Use `useTreeView` hook with `TreeView.RootProvider` for programmatic control
- Pass `scrollToIndexFn` to enable keyboard navigation within the virtualized list
- Use `getVisibleNodes()` to get the flattened list of currently visible nodes

**Example: virtualized**

#### React

```tsx
import { TreeView, createTreeCollection, useTreeView } from '@ark-ui/react/tree-view'

  const folders: Node[] = []
  for (let i = 0; i < 50; i++) {
    const children: Node[] = []
    for (let j = 0; j < 20; j++) {
      children.push({ id: `folder-${i}/file-${i}-${j}.ts`, name: `file-${i}-${j}.ts` })
    }
    folders.push({ id: `folder-${i}`, name: `folder-${i}`, children })
  }

### Checkbox Tree

Use the `defaultCheckedValue` prop to enable checkbox selection mode. This allows users to select multiple nodes with
checkboxes, including parent-child selection relationships.

**Example: checkbox-tree**

### Expand and Collapse All

Use the `expand()` and `collapse()` methods from the tree view context to programmatically expand or collapse all
branches.

**Example: expand-collapse-all**

### Mutation

Use the collection's `remove()` and `replace()` methods to dynamically add and remove nodes from the tree. This is
useful for building file explorer interfaces where users can create and delete files.

**Example: mutation**

#### React

```tsx
import { TreeView, createTreeCollection, useTreeViewContext } from '@ark-ui/react/tree-view'

export const Mutation = () => {
  const [collection, setCollection] = useState(initialCollection)

  const removeNode = (props: TreeNodeProps) => {
    setCollection(collection.remove([props.indexPath]))
  }

  const addNode = (props: TreeNodeProps) => {
    const { node, indexPath } = props
    if (!collection.isBranchNode(node)) return
    const children = [{ id: `untitled-${Date.now()}`, name: 'untitled.tsx' }, ...(node.children || [])]
    setCollection(collection.replace(indexPath, { ...node, children }))
  }

  return (
    <TreeView.Root className={styles.Root} collection={collection}>

        ))}
      </TreeView.Tree>
    </TreeView.Root>
  )

### Rename Node

Enable inline renaming of nodes using the `canRename` prop and `onRenameComplete` callback. Press <kbd>F2</kbd> to
activate rename mode on the focused node.

**Example: rename-node**

## Guides

### Type Safety

The `TreeView.RootComponent` type enables you to create typed wrapper components that maintain full type safety for tree
nodes.

```tsx
import { TreeView as ArkTreeView } from '@ark-ui/react/tree-view'

const TreeView: ArkTreeView.RootComponent = (props) => {
  return <ArkTreeView.Root {...props}>{/* ... */}</ArkTreeView.Root>
}
```

Use the wrapper with full type inference on `onSelectionChange` and other callbacks:

```tsx
const App = () => {
  const collection = createTreeCollection({
    initialItems: [
      { id: '1', label: 'React', children: [] },
      { id: '2', label: 'Vue', children: [] },
    ],
  })
  return (
    <TreeView
      collection={collection}
      onSelectionChange={(e) => {
        // e.items is typed as Array<{ id: string, label: string, children: [] }>
        console.log(e.items)
      }}
    >
      {/* ... */}
    </TreeView>
  )
}
```

## Accessibility

Complies with the [Tree View WAI-ARIA design pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/treeview/).

### Keyboard Support

**`Tab`**
Description: Moves focus to the tree view, placing the first tree view item in focus.

**`Enter + Space`**
Description: Selects the item or branch node

**`ArrowDown`**
Description: Moves focus to the next node

**`ArrowUp`**
Description: Moves focus to the previous node

**`ArrowRight`**
Description: When focus is on a closed branch node, opens the branch.<br> When focus is on an open branch node, moves focus to the first item node.

**`ArrowLeft`**
Description: When focus is on an open branch node, closes the node.<br> When focus is on an item or branch node, moves focus to its parent branch node.

**`Home`**
Description: Moves focus to first node without opening or closing a node.

**`End`**
Description: Moves focus to the last node that can be focused without expanding any nodes that are closed.

**`a-z + A-Z`**
Description: Focus moves to the next node with a name that starts with the typed character. The search logic ignores nodes that are descendants of closed branch.

**`*`**
Description: Expands all sibling nodes that are at the same depth as the focused node.

**`Shift + ArrowDown`**
Description: Moves focus to and toggles the selection state of the next node.

**`Shift + ArrowUp`**
Description: Moves focus to and toggles the selection state of the previous node.

**`Ctrl + A`**
Description: Selects all nodes in the tree. If all nodes are selected, unselects all nodes.



# UTILITIES

# Client Only

## Motivation

The `ClientOnly` component renders its children only on the client side. This is useful for components that need to
access the DOM or browser APIs that are not available on the server side.

## Examples

### Basic

**Example: basic**

#### React

```tsx
import { ClientOnly } from '@ark-ui/react/client-only'

export const Basic = () => (
  <ClientOnly>
    <div>This content is only rendered on the client side.</div>
  </ClientOnly>
)

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { ClientOnly } from '@ark-ui/solid/client-only'

export const Basic = () => (
  <ClientOnly>
    <div>This content is only rendered on the client side.</div>
  </ClientOnly>
)

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { ClientOnly } from '@ark-ui/vue/client-only'
</script>

<template>
  <ClientOnly>
    <div>This content is only rendered on the client side.</div>
  </ClientOnly>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { ClientOnly } from '@ark-ui/svelte/client-only'
</script>

<ClientOnly>
  <div>This content is only rendered on the client side.</div>
</ClientOnly>

```

### With Fallback

**Example: with-fallback**

#### React

```tsx
import { ClientOnly } from '@ark-ui/react/client-only'

export const WithFallback = () => (
  <ClientOnly fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
    <div>This content is only rendered on the client side.</div>
  </ClientOnly>
)

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { ClientOnly } from '@ark-ui/solid/client-only'

export const WithFallback = () => (
  <ClientOnly fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
    <div>This content is only rendered on the client side.</div>
  </ClientOnly>
)

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { ClientOnly } from '@ark-ui/vue/client-only'
</script>

<template>
  <ClientOnly>
    <template #fallback>
      <div>Loading...</div>
    </template>
    <div>This content is only rendered on the client side.</div>
  </ClientOnly>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { ClientOnly } from '@ark-ui/svelte/client-only'
</script>

<ClientOnly>
  {#snippet fallback()}
    <div>Loading...</div>
  {/snippet}
  <div>This content is only rendered on the client side.</div>

# Download Trigger

## Motivation

The `DownloadTrigger` component provides a convenient way to programmatically trigger file downloads in web
applications. It handles the complexities of downloading files, whether they are URLs, Blobs, or other data types.

## Examples

### Basic

Pass the data you want to download to the `data` prop, and specify the `fileName` and `mimeType` of the file.

**Example: basic**

#### React

```tsx
import { DownloadTrigger } from '@ark-ui/react/download-trigger'
import { DownloadIcon, FileIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/download-trigger.module.css'

const content = 'Hello, World! This is a sample text file.'

export const Basic = () => {
  return (
    <div className={styles.Root}>
      <div className={styles.Preview}>
        <FileIcon />
        <span className={styles.PreviewText}>{content}</span>
      </div>
      <DownloadTrigger className={button.Root} data={content} fileName="hello.txt" mimeType="text/plain">
        <DownloadIcon /> Download txt
      </DownloadTrigger>
    </div>
  )
}

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { DownloadTrigger } from '@ark-ui/solid/download-trigger'
import { DownloadIcon, FileIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/download-trigger.module.css'

const content = 'Hello, World! This is a sample text file.'

export const Basic = () => {
  return (
    <div class={styles.Root}>
      <div class={styles.Preview}>
        <FileIcon />
        <span class={styles.PreviewText}>{content}</span>
      </div>
      <DownloadTrigger class={button.Root} data={content} fileName="hello.txt" mimeType="text/plain">
        <DownloadIcon /> Download txt
      </DownloadTrigger>
    </div>
  )
}

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { DownloadTrigger } from '@ark-ui/vue/download-trigger'
import { DownloadIcon, FileIcon } from 'lucide-vue-next'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/download-trigger.module.css'

const content = 'Hello, World! This is a sample text file.'
</script>

<template>
  <div :class="styles.Root">
    <div :class="styles.Preview">
      <FileIcon />
      <span :class="styles.PreviewText">{{ content }}</span>
    </div>
    <DownloadTrigger :class="button.Root" :data="content" fileName="hello.txt" mimeType="text/plain">
      <DownloadIcon />
      Download txt
    </DownloadTrigger>
  </div>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { DownloadTrigger } from '@ark-ui/svelte/download-trigger'
  import { DownloadIcon, FileIcon } from 'lucide-svelte'
  import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
  import styles from 'styles/download-trigger.module.css'

  const content = 'Hello, World! This is a sample text file.'
</script>

<div class={styles.Root}>
  <div class={styles.Preview}>
    <FileIcon />
    <span class={styles.PreviewText}>{content}</span>
  </div>
  <DownloadTrigger class={button.Root} data={content} fileName="hello.txt" mimeType="text/plain">
    <DownloadIcon /> Download txt
  </DownloadTrigger>
</div>

```

### Download SVG

Here's an example of how to download an SVG file.

**Example: svg**

#### React

```

### Promise

You can also trigger downloads from a promise that returns a `Blob`, `File`, or `string`.

**Example: with-promise**

#### React

```tsx
import { DownloadTrigger } from '@ark-ui/react/download-trigger'
import { DownloadIcon, ImageIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/download-trigger.module.css'

export const WithPromise = () => {
  const fetchImage = async () => {
    const response = await fetch('https://picsum.photos/200/300')
    return response.blob()
  }

  return (
    <div className={styles.Root}>
      <div className={styles.Preview}>
        <ImageIcon />
        <span className={styles.PreviewText}>random-image.jpg (fetched on download)</span>
      </div>
      <DownloadTrigger className={button.Root} data={fetchImage} fileName="random-image.jpg" mimeType="image/jpeg">
        <DownloadIcon /> Download Image
      </DownloadTrigger>
    </div>
  )
}

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { DownloadTrigger } from '@ark-ui/solid/download-trigger'
import { DownloadIcon, ImageIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/download-trigger.module.css'

export const WithPromise = () => {
  const fetchImage = async () => {
    const response = await fetch('https://picsum.photos/200/300')
    return response.blob()
  }

  return (
    <div class={styles.Root}>
      <div class={styles.Preview}>
        <ImageIcon />
        <span class={styles.PreviewText}>random-image.jpg (fetched on download)</span>
      </div>
      <DownloadTrigger class={button.Root} data={fetchImage} fileName="random-image.jpg" mimeType="image/jpeg">
        <DownloadIcon /> Download Image
      </DownloadTrigger>
    </div>
  )
}

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { DownloadTrigger } from '@ark-ui/vue/download-trigger'
import { DownloadIcon, ImageIcon } from 'lucide-vue-next'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/download-trigger.module.css'

const fetchImage = async () => {
  const response = await fetch('https://picsum.photos/200/300')
  return response.blob()
}

# Environment

## Motivation

We use [Zag.js](https://zagjs.com/overview/composition#custom-window-environment) internally, which relies on DOM query
methods like `document.querySelectorAll` and `document.getElementById`. In custom environments like iframes, Shadow DOM,
or Electron, these methods might not work as expected.

To handle this, Ark UI includes the `EnvironmentProvider`, allowing you to set the appropriate root node or document,
ensuring correct DOM queries.

## Setup

To support custom environments like an iframe, Shadow DOM or Electron, render the `EnvironmentProvider` component to
provide the environment context to all Ark UI components.

<ExampleCode id="setup" component="environment" />

### Usage in iframe

The `EnvironmentProvider` component will automatically detect the current environment and set the correct environment
context. However, you can also manually set the `Document` like shown in this React example below:

```jsx
import Frame, { FrameContextConsumer } from 'react-frame-component'
import { EnvironmentProvider } from '@ark-ui/react'

export const App = () => (
  <Frame title="IFrame Context">
    <FrameContextConsumer>
      {({ document }) => <EnvironmentProvider value={document}>{/* Your App */}</EnvironmentProvider>}
    </FrameContextConsumer>
  </Frame>
)
```

### Usage in Shadow DOM

Here's an example of how to set the `EnvironmentProvider`'s value with Shadow DOM in Solid.js `Portal` component.

```jsx
import { EnvironmentProvider } from '@ark-ui/react'
import { Index, Portal } from 'solid-js/web'

export const App = () => {
  let portalNode
  return (
    <Portal ref={portalNode} useShadow={true}>
      <EnvironmentProvider value={() => portalNode?.shadowRoot ?? document}>{/* Your App */}</EnvironmentProvider>
    </Portal>
  )
}
```

## Context

Use the `useEnvironmentContext` hook to access the `RootNode`, `Document`, and `Window`.

<ExampleCode id="usage" component="environment" />

# Focus Trap

## Motivation

Focus trapping is essential for modal interfaces and other interactive elements that require user attention.

The `FocusTrap` component helps maintain accessibility by ensuring keyboard focus remains within a designated container
until explicitly released.

## Examples

**Example: basic**

#### React

```tsx
import { FocusTrap } from '@ark-ui/react/focus-trap'
import { useState } from 'react'

export const Basic = () => {
  const [trapped, setTrapped] = useState(false)
  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => setTrapped(true)}>Start Trap</button>
      <FocusTrap returnFocusOnDeactivate={false} disabled={!trapped}>
        <div
          style={{
            display: 'flex',
            flexDirection: 'column',
            gap: '1rem',
            paddingBlock: '1rem',
          }}
        >
          <input type="text" placeholder="input" />
          <textarea placeholder="textarea" />
          <button onClick={() => setTrapped(false)}>End Trap</button>
        </div>
      </FocusTrap>
    </>
  )
}

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { FocusTrap } from '@ark-ui/solid/focus-trap'
import { createSignal } from 'solid-js'

export const Basic = () => {
  const [trapped, setTrapped] = createSignal(false)
  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => setTrapped(true)}>Start Trap</button>
      <FocusTrap returnFocusOnDeactivate={false} disabled={!trapped()}>
        <div
          style={{
            display: 'flex',
            'flex-direction': 'column',
            gap: '1rem',
            'padding-block': '1rem',
          }}
        >
          <input type="text" placeholder="input" />
          <textarea placeholder="textarea" />
          <button onClick={() => setTrapped(false)}>End Trap</button>
        </div>
      </FocusTrap>
    </>
  )
}

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { FocusTrap } from '@ark-ui/vue/focus-trap'
import { ref } from 'vue'

const trapped = ref(false)
</script>

<template>
  <button @click="trapped = true">Start Trap</button>
  <FocusTrap :return-focus-on-deactivate="false" :disabled="!trapped">
    <div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; gap: 1rem; padding-block: 1rem">
      <input type="text" placeholder="input" />
      <textarea placeholder="textarea" />
      <button @click="trapped = false">End Trap</button>
    </div>
  </FocusTrap>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { FocusTrap } from '@ark-ui/svelte/focus-trap'

  let trapped = $state(false)
</script>

<button onclick={() => (trapped = true)}>Start Trap</button>

<FocusTrap returnFocusOnDeactivate={false} disabled={!trapped}>
  <div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; gap: 1rem; padding-block: 1rem">
    <input type="text" placeholder="input" />
    <textarea placeholder="textarea"></textarea>
    <button onclick={() => (trapped = false)}>End Trap</button>
  </div>
</FocusTrap>

```

### Autofocus

The focus trap respects elements with the `autofocus` attribute.

**Example: autofocus**

#### React

```tsx
import { FocusTrap } from '@ark-ui/react/focus-trap'
import { useRef, useState } from 'react'

export const Autofocus = () => {
  const [trapped, setTrapped] = useState(false)
  const toggle = () => setTrapped((c) => !c)

  const buttonRef = useRef<HTMLButtonElement | null>(null)
  const getButtonNode = () => {
    const node = buttonRef.current
    if (!node) throw new Error('Button not found')
    return node
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <button ref={buttonRef} onClick={toggle}>
        {trapped ? 'End Trap' : 'Start Trap'}
      </button>
      {trapped && (
        <FocusTrap disabled={!trapped} setReturnFocus={getButtonNode}>
          <div
            style={{
              display: 'flex',
              flexDirection: 'column',
              gap: '1rem',
              paddingBlock: '1rem',
            }}
          >
            <input type="text" placeholder="Regular input" />

**Example: initial-focus**

#### React

```tsx
import { FocusTrap } from '@ark-ui/react/focus-trap'
import { useRef, useState } from 'react'

export const InitialFocus = () => {
  const [trapped, setTrapped] = useState(false)
  const toggle = () => setTrapped((c) => !c)

  const inputRef = useRef<HTMLInputElement>(null)

  return (
    <div>

## API Reference

**Component API Reference**

#### React

**FocusTrap Props:**

| Prop | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| `asChild` | `boolean` | No | Use the provided child element as the default rendered element, combining their props and behavior. |
| `disabled` | `boolean` | No | Whether the focus trap is disabled. |
| `fallbackFocus` | `FocusTarget` | No | By default, an error will be thrown if the focus trap contains no
elements in its tab order. With this option you can specify a
fallback element to programmatically receive focus if no other
tabbable elements are found. For example, you may want a popover's
`<div>` to receive focus if the popover's content includes no
tabbable elements. *Make sure the fallback element has a negative
`tabindex` so it can be programmatically focused.

NOTE: If `initialFocus` is `false` (or a function that returns `false`),
this function will not be called when the trap is activated, and no element
will be initially focused. This function may still be called while the trap
is active if things change such that there are no longer any tabbable nodes
in the trap. |
| `initialFocus` | `VoidFunction | FocusTargetOrFalse` | No | By default, when a focus trap is activated the first element in the
focus trap's tab order will receive focus. With this option you can
specify a different element to receive that initial focus, or use `false`
for no initially focused element at all.

NOTE: Setting this option to `false` (or a function that returns `false`)
will prevent the `fallbackFocus` option from being used.

Setting this option to `undefined` (or a function that returns `undefined`)
will result in the default behavior. |
| `onActivate` | `VoidFunction` | No | A function that will be called **before** sending focus to the
target element upon activation. |
| `onDeactivate` | `VoidFunction` | No | A function that will be called **before** sending focus to the
trigger element upon deactivation. |
| `returnFocusOnDeactivate` | `boolean` | No | Default: `true`. If `false`, when the trap is deactivated,
focus will *not* return to the element that had focus before activation. |
| `setReturnFocus` | `type ONLY_FOR_FORMAT =
  | FocusTargetValueOrFalse
  | ((nodeFocusedBeforeActivation: HTMLElement | SVGElement) => FocusTargetValueOrFalse)` | No | By default, focus trap on deactivation will return to the element
that was focused before activation. |

# Format Byte



## Usage

The byte formatting component extends the number formatting capabilities to handle byte-specific formatting, including
automatic unit conversion and display options.

```jsx
import { Format } from '@ark-ui/react'
```

## Examples

### Basic

Use the `Format.Byte` component to format a byte value with default options.

```tsx
import { Format } from '@ark-ui/react/format'
import styles from 'styles/format.module.css'

export const ByteBasic = () => {
  return (
    <div className={styles.Root}>
      <span className={styles.Label}>File size</span>
      <span className={styles.Value}>
        <Format.Byte value={120000} />
      </span>
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Sizes

Use the `sizes` prop to specify custom byte sizes for formatting.

```tsx
import { Format } from '@ark-ui/react/format'
import styles from 'styles/format.module.css'

export const ByteSizes = () => {
  const byteSizes = [50, 5000, 5000000, 5000000000]

  return (
    <div className={styles.List}>
      {byteSizes.map((size) => (
        <div key={size} className={styles.ListItem}>
          <span className={styles.Value}>
            <Format.Byte value={size} />
          </span>
        </div>
      ))}
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Locale

Use the `locale` prop to format the byte value according to a specific locale.

```tsx
import { Format } from '@ark-ui/react/format'
import { LocaleProvider } from '@ark-ui/react/locale'
import styles from 'styles/format.module.css'

export const ByteWithLocale = () => {
  const locales = ['de-DE', 'zh-CN']

  return (
    <div className={styles.List}>
      {locales.map((locale) => (
        <LocaleProvider key={locale} locale={locale}>
          <div className={styles.ListItem}>
            <span className={styles.InlineLabel}>{locale}:</span>
            <span className={styles.Value}>
              <Format.Byte value={1450.45} />
            </span>
          </div>
        </LocaleProvider>
      ))}
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Unit

Use the `unit` prop to specify the unit of the byte value.

```tsx
import { Format } from '@ark-ui/react/format'
import styles from 'styles/format.module.css'

export const ByteWithUnit = () => {
  return (
    <div className={styles.Inline}>
      <span className={styles.InlineLabel}>File size:</span>
      <span className={styles.InlineValue}>
        <Format.Byte value={1450.45} unit="bit" />
      </span>
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Unit Display

Use the `unitDisplay` prop to specify the display of the unit.

```tsx
import { Format } from '@ark-ui/react/format'
import styles from 'styles/format.module.css'

export const ByteWithUnitDisplay = () => {
  const unitDisplays = ['narrow', 'short', 'long'] as const

  return (
    <div className={styles.List}>
      {unitDisplays.map((unitDisplay) => (
        <div key={unitDisplay} className={styles.ListItem}>
          <span className={styles.InlineLabel}>{unitDisplay}:</span>
          <span className={styles.Value}>
            <Format.Byte value={50345.53} unitDisplay={unitDisplay} />
          </span>
        </div>
      ))}
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Unit System

Use the `unitSystem` prop to specify whether to use decimal (1000 bytes) or binary (1024 bytes) unit system.

```tsx
import { Format } from '@ark-ui/react/format'
import styles from 'styles/format.module.css'

export const ByteWithUnitSystem = () => {
  return (
    <div className={styles.List}>
      <div className={styles.ListItem}>
        <span className={styles.InlineLabel}>Decimal (1000 bytes):</span>
        <span className={styles.InlineValue}>
          <Format.Byte value={1024} unitSystem="decimal" />
        </span>
      </div>
      <div className={styles.ListItem}>
        <span className={styles.InlineLabel}>Binary (1024 bytes):</span>
        <span className={styles.InlineValue}>
          <Format.Byte value={1024} unitSystem="binary" />
        </span>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```


# Format Relative Time



## Usage

The relative time formatting logic is handled by the native `Intl.RelativeTimeFormat` API and smartly cached to avoid
performance issues when using the same locale and options.

```jsx
import { Format } from '@ark-ui/react'
```

## Examples

### Basic

Use the `Format.RelativeTime` component to format a relative time with default options.

```tsx
import { Format } from '@ark-ui/react/format'
import styles from 'styles/format.module.css'

export const RelativeTimeBasic = () => {
  return (
    <div className={styles.Inline}>
      <span className={styles.InlineLabel}>Last updated</span>
      <span className={styles.InlineValue}>
        <Format.RelativeTime value={new Date('2025-05-05')} />
      </span>
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Short

Use the `style="short"` prop to format the relative time in short format.

```tsx
import { Format } from '@ark-ui/react/format'
import styles from 'styles/format.module.css'

export const RelativeTimeShort = () => {
  return (
    <div className={styles.Inline}>
      <span className={styles.InlineLabel}>Edited</span>
      <span className={styles.InlineValue}>
        <Format.RelativeTime value={new Date('2025-05-05')} style="short" />
      </span>
    </div>
  )
}
```


# Frame



## Usage

The `Frame` component is used to render a component in an iframe.

- Tracks the size of the content and exposes them via css variables.
- Support for `head` prop to inject scripts and styles.
- Support for mount and unmount callbacks.

```jsx
import { Frame } from '@ark-ui/react'
```

## Examples

### Basic

Wrap your component in the `Frame` component to render it in an iframe.

```tsx
import { Frame } from '@ark-ui/react/frame'

export const Basic = () => {
  return (
    <Frame
      title="Custom Frame"
      style={{ border: '1px solid #ccc', width: '100%', height: 'var(--height)' }}
      head={<style>{'body { background-color: #f0f0f0; }'}</style>}
    >
      <div style={{ padding: '40px' }}>
        <h1>Hello from inside the frame!</h1>
        <p>This content is rendered within our custom frame component using a Portal.</p>
      </div>
    </Frame>
  )
}
```

### Injecting Script

Using the `onMount` prop, you can inject a script into the iframe.

```tsx
import { Frame } from '@ark-ui/react/frame'
import { useRef } from 'react'

export const Script = () => {
  const ref = useRef<HTMLIFrameElement>(null)
  return (
    <Frame
      ref={ref}
      title="Custom Frame"
      onMount={() => {
        const doc = ref.current?.contentDocument
        if (!doc) return
        const script = doc.createElement('script')
        script.innerHTML = 'console.log("Hello from inside the frame!")'
        doc.body.appendChild(script)
      }}
      style={{ border: '1px solid #ccc', width: '100%', height: 'var(--height)' }}
    >
      <div style={{ padding: '40px' }}>
        <h1>Hello from inside the frame!</h1>
        <p>This content is rendered within our custom frame component using a Portal.</p>
      </div>
    </Frame>
  )
}
```

### Custom src doc

Use the `srcDoc` prop to specify the HTML content of the page to use in the iframe.

```tsx
import { Frame } from '@ark-ui/react/frame'

const srcDoc = `<html><head>
<link href="//use.fontawesome.com/releases/v5.15.1/css/all.css" rel="stylesheet" />
<link href="//fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,300,600,700" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
<base target=_blank>
</head><body style='overflow: hidden'><div></div></body></html>`

export const SrcDoc = () => {
  return (
    <Frame title="Custom Frame" style={{ border: '1px solid #ccc', maxWidth: '800px', width: '100%' }} srcDoc={srcDoc}>
      <h1 style={{ fontFamily: 'Open Sans, sans-serif' }}>Hello from inside the frame!</h1>
      <p>This content is rendered within our custom frame component using a Portal.</p>
      <p>The frame has custom initial content, including Font Awesome and Open Sans font.</p>
    </Frame>
  )
}
```

# Highlight



## Usage

The Highlight component takes a `text` prop containing the full text and a `query` prop specifying the text to
highlight. It then renders the text with highlighted portions wrapped in `<mark>` tags.

**Example: basic**

#### React

```tsx
import { Highlight } from '@ark-ui/react/highlight'
import styles from 'styles/highlight.module.css'

export const Basic = () => (
  <p className={styles.Text}>
    <Highlight
      className={styles.Mark}
      query="component"
      text="Ark UI is a headless component library for building accessible web applications."
    />
  </p>
)

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Highlight } from '@ark-ui/solid/highlight'
import styles from 'styles/highlight.module.css'

export const Basic = () => (
  <p class={styles.Text}>
    <Highlight
      class={styles.Mark}
      query="component"
      text="Ark UI is a headless component library for building accessible web applications."
    />
  </p>
)

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Highlight } from '@ark-ui/vue/highlight'
import styles from 'styles/highlight.module.css'
</script>

<template>
  <p :class="styles.Text">
    <Highlight
      :class="styles.Mark"
      query="component"
      text="Ark UI is a headless component library for building accessible web applications."
    />
  </p>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Highlight } from '@ark-ui/svelte/highlight'
  import styles from 'styles/highlight.module.css'
</script>

<p class={styles.Text}>
  <Highlight
    class={styles.Mark}
    query="component"
    text="Ark UI is a headless component library for building accessible web applications."
  />
</p>

```

### Dynamic Query

Control the `query` prop with state to create an interactive search highlighting experience.

**Example: dynamic-query**

#### React

```tsx
import { Highlight } from '@ark-ui/react/highlight'
import { useState } from 'react'
import field from 'styles/field.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/highlight.module.css'

export const DynamicQuery = () => {
  const [query, setQuery] = useState('component')
  return (
    <div className={styles.Root}>
      <input
        className={field.Input}
        type="text"
        placeholder="Search text..."
        value={query}
        onChange={(e) => setQuery(e.target.value)}
      />
      <p className={styles.Text}>
        <Highlight
          className={styles.Mark}
          query={query}
          text="With Ark UI, you can build accessible, custom components. Each component is fully typed and works seamlessly with React, Solid, Svelte, and Vue."
        />
      </p>
    </div>
  )
}

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Highlight } from '@ark-ui/solid/highlight'
import { createSignal } from 'solid-js'
import field from 'styles/field.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/highlight.module.css'

export const DynamicQuery = () => {
  const [query, setQuery] = createSignal('component')
  return (
    <div class={styles.Root}>
      <input
        class={field.Input}
        type="text"
        placeholder="Search text..."
        value={query()}
        onInput={(e) => setQuery(e.target.value)}
      />
      <p class={styles.Text}>
        <Highlight
          class={styles.Mark}
          query={query()}
          text="With Ark UI, you can build accessible, custom components. Each component is fully typed and works seamlessly with React, Solid, Svelte, and Vue."
        />
      </p>
    </div>
  )
}

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Highlight } from '@ark-ui/vue/highlight'
import { ref } from 'vue'
import field from 'styles/field.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/highlight.module.css'

const query = ref('component')
</script>

<template>
  <div :class="styles.Root">
    <input :class="field.Input" type="text" placeholder="Search text..." v-model="query" />
    <p :class="styles.Text">
      <Highlight
        :class="styles.Mark"
        :query="query"
        text="With Ark UI, you can build accessible, custom components. Each component is fully typed and works seamlessly with React, Solid, Svelte, and Vue."
      />
    </p>
  </div>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Highlight } from '@ark-ui/svelte/highlight'
  import field from 'styles/field.module.css'
  import styles from 'styles/highlight.module.css'

  let query = $state('component')
</script>

<div class={styles.Root}>
  <input class={field.Input} type="text" placeholder="Search text..." bind:value={query} />
  <p class={styles.Text}>
    <Highlight
      class={styles.Mark}
      {query}
      text="With Ark UI, you can build accessible, custom components. Each component is fully typed and works seamlessly with React, Solid, Svelte, and Vue."
    />
  </p>
</div>

```

### Multiple Queries

You can highlight multiple terms by passing an array of strings to the `query` prop.

**Example: multiple**

#### React

```tsx
import { Highlight } from '@ark-ui/react/highlight'
import styles from 'styles/highlight.module.css'

export const Multiple = () => (
  <p className={styles.Text}>
    <Highlight
      className={styles.Mark}
      query={['React', 'Vue']}
      text="Ark UI provides React, Solid, Vue, and Svelte components that are accessible and customizable."
    />
  </p>
)

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Highlight } from '@ark-ui/solid/highlight'
import styles from 'styles/highlight.module.css'

export const Multiple = () => (
  <p class={styles.Text}>
    <Highlight
      class={styles.Mark}
      query={['React', 'Vue']}
      text="Ark UI provides React, Solid, Vue, and Svelte components that are accessible and customizable."
    />
  </p>
)

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Highlight } from '@ark-ui/vue/highlight'
import styles from 'styles/highlight.module.css'
</script>

<template>
  <p :class="styles.Text">
    <Highlight
      :class="styles.Mark"
      :query="['React', 'Vue']"
      text="Ark UI provides React, Solid, Vue, and Svelte components that are accessible and customizable."
    />
  </p>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Highlight } from '@ark-ui/svelte/highlight'
  import styles from 'styles/highlight.module.css'
</script>

<p class={styles.Text}>
  <Highlight
    class={styles.Mark}
    query={['React', 'Vue']}
    text="Ark UI provides React, Solid, Vue, and Svelte components that are accessible and customizable."
  />
</p>

```

### Case Sensitivity

By default, the highlighting is case-sensitive. Use the `ignoreCase` prop to make it case-insensitive.

**Example: ignore-case**

#### React

```tsx
import { Highlight } from '@ark-ui/react/highlight'
import styles from 'styles/highlight.module.css'

export const IgnoreCase = () => (
  <p className={styles.Text}>
    <Highlight
      className={styles.Mark}
      text="TypeScript provides static type checking. Using typescript helps catch errors early in development."
      query="typescript"
      ignoreCase
    />
  </p>
)

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Highlight } from '@ark-ui/solid/highlight'
import styles from 'styles/highlight.module.css'

export const IgnoreCase = () => (
  <p class={styles.Text}>
    <Highlight
      class={styles.Mark}
      text="TypeScript provides static type checking. Using typescript helps catch errors early in development."
      query="typescript"
      ignoreCase
    />
  </p>
)

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Highlight } from '@ark-ui/vue/highlight'
import styles from 'styles/highlight.module.css'
</script>

<template>
  <p :class="styles.Text">
    <Highlight
      :class="styles.Mark"
      text="TypeScript provides static type checking. Using typescript helps catch errors early in development."
      query="typescript"
      ignore-case
    />
  </p>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Highlight } from '@ark-ui/svelte/highlight'
  import styles from 'styles/highlight.module.css'
</script>

<p class={styles.Text}>
  <Highlight
    class={styles.Mark}
    text="TypeScript provides static type checking. Using typescript helps catch errors early in development."
    query="typescript"
    ignoreCase
  />
</p>

```

### Match All

By default, the Highlight component matches the first occurrence of the query. To highlight all occurrences of the
query, set the `matchAll` prop to `true`.

**Example: match-all**

#### React

```tsx
import { Highlight } from '@ark-ui/react/highlight'
import styles from 'styles/highlight.module.css'

export const MatchAll = () => (
  <div className={styles.Root}>
    <div className={styles.Section}>
      <span className={styles.Label}>Match All</span>
      <p className={styles.Text}>
        <Highlight
          className={styles.Mark}
          text="Each component follows WAI-ARIA guidelines. Every component is rigorously tested to ensure accessibility."
          query="component"
          matchAll
        />
      </p>
    </div>
    <div className={styles.Section}>
      <span className={styles.Label}>Match First Only</span>
      <p className={styles.Text}>
        <Highlight
          className={styles.Mark}
          text="Each component follows WAI-ARIA guidelines. Every component is rigorously tested to ensure accessibility."
          query="component"
          matchAll={false}
        />
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
)

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Highlight } from '@ark-ui/solid/highlight'
import styles from 'styles/highlight.module.css'

export const MatchAll = () => (
  <div class={styles.Root}>
    <div class={styles.Section}>
      <span class={styles.Label}>Match All</span>
      <p class={styles.Text}>
        <Highlight
          class={styles.Mark}
          text="Each component follows WAI-ARIA guidelines. Every component is rigorously tested to ensure accessibility."
          query="component"
          matchAll
        />
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class={styles.Section}>
      <span class={styles.Label}>Match First Only</span>
      <p class={styles.Text}>
        <Highlight
          class={styles.Mark}
          text="Each component follows WAI-ARIA guidelines. Every component is rigorously tested to ensure accessibility."
          query="component"
          matchAll={false}
        />
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
)

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Highlight } from '@ark-ui/vue/highlight'
import styles from 'styles/highlight.module.css'
</script>

<template>
  <div :class="styles.Root">
    <div :class="styles.Section">
      <span :class="styles.Label">Match All</span>
      <p :class="styles.Text">
        <Highlight
          :class="styles.Mark"
          text="Each component follows WAI-ARIA guidelines. Every component is rigorously tested to ensure accessibility."
          query="component"
          match-all
        />

          query="component"
          :match-all="false"
        />
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Highlight } from '@ark-ui/svelte/highlight'
  import styles from 'styles/highlight.module.css'
</script>

<div class={styles.Root}>
  <div class={styles.Section}>
    <span class={styles.Label}>Match All</span>
    <p class={styles.Text}>
      <Highlight
        class={styles.Mark}
        text="Each component follows WAI-ARIA guidelines. Every component is rigorously tested to ensure accessibility."
        query="component"
        matchAll
      />
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class={styles.Section}>

        query="component"
        matchAll={false}
      />
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

```

### Exact Match

By default, the Highlight component matches partial words. Use the `exactMatch` prop to only highlight whole words that
match the query exactly.

**Example: exact-match**

#### React

```tsx
import { Highlight } from '@ark-ui/react/highlight'
import styles from 'styles/highlight.module.css'

export const ExactMatch = () => (
  <div className={styles.Root}>
    <div className={styles.Section}>
      <span className={styles.Label}>Partial Match</span>
      <p className={styles.Text}>
        <Highlight
          className={styles.Mark}
          query="box"
          text="The checkbox component renders a box element. Use combobox for autocomplete."
          matchAll
        />
      </p>
    </div>
    <div className={styles.Section}>
      <span className={styles.Label}>Exact Match</span>
      <p className={styles.Text}>
        <Highlight
          className={styles.Mark}
          query="box"
          text="The checkbox component renders a box element. Use combobox for autocomplete."
          exactMatch
          matchAll
        />
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
)

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Highlight } from '@ark-ui/solid/highlight'
import styles from 'styles/highlight.module.css'

export const ExactMatch = () => (
  <div class={styles.Root}>
    <div class={styles.Section}>
      <span class={styles.Label}>Partial Match</span>
      <p class={styles.Text}>
        <Highlight
          class={styles.Mark}
          query="box"
          text="The checkbox component renders a box element. Use combobox for autocomplete."

style the highlighted portions.

```tsx
<Highlight
  text="Ark UI is a headless component library for building accessible web applications."
  query="component"
  className="highlight-mark"
/>
```

Style the `mark` tags using CSS to customize the appearance of highlighted text.

```css
.highlight-mark {
  background-color: #ffe5e4;
  color: #c9453b;
  border-radius: 0.125rem;
}
```


# JSON Tree View



## Anatomy

To set up the JSON tree view correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.



## Examples

Learn how to use the `JsonTreeView` component in your project. Let's take a look at the most basic example:

**Example: basic**

#### React

```tsx
import { JsonTreeView } from '@ark-ui/react/json-tree-view'
import { ChevronRightIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import styles from 'styles/json-tree-view.module.css'

export const Basic = () => {
  return (
    <JsonTreeView.Root
      defaultExpandedDepth={1}
      className={styles.Root}
      data={{
        name: 'John Doe',
        age: 30,
        email: 'john.doe@example.com',
        tags: ['tag1', 'tag2', 'tag3'],
        address: {
          street: '123 Main St',
          city: 'Anytown',
          state: 'CA',
          zip: '12345',
        },
      }}
    >
      <JsonTreeView.Tree className={styles.Tree} arrow={<ChevronRightIcon />} />
    </JsonTreeView.Root>
  )
}

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { JsonTreeView } from '@ark-ui/solid/json-tree-view'
import { ChevronRightIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import styles from 'styles/json-tree-view.module.css'

export const Basic = () => {
  return (
    <JsonTreeView.Root
      defaultExpandedDepth={1}
      class={styles.Root}
      data={{
        name: 'John Doe',
        age: 30,
        email: 'john.doe@example.com',
        tags: ['tag1', 'tag2', 'tag3'],
        address: {
          street: '123 Main St',
          city: 'Anytown',
          state: 'CA',
          zip: '12345',
        },
      }}
    >
      <JsonTreeView.Tree class={styles.Tree} arrow={<ChevronRightIcon />} />
    </JsonTreeView.Root>
  )
}

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">

  </JsonTreeView.Tree>
</JsonTreeView.Root>

```

### Different Data Types

The JSON tree view can display various JavaScript data types including objects, arrays, primitives, and special values:

**Example: array-data**

#### React

```tsx
import { JsonTreeView } from '@ark-ui/react/json-tree-view'
import { ChevronRightIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import styles from 'styles/json-tree-view.module.css'

const testArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Object.defineProperties(testArray, {
  customProperty: { value: 'custom value', enumerable: false, writable: false },
  anotherProperty: { value: 42, enumerable: false, writable: false },
})

export const ArrayData = () => {
  return (
    <JsonTreeView.Root
      defaultExpandedDepth={1}
      className={styles.Root}
      data={{
        normalArray: [1, 2, 3],
        arrayWithNonEnumerableProperties: testArray,
        sparseArray: (() => {
          const sparse = []
          sparse[0] = 'first'
          sparse[5] = 'sixth'
          return sparse
        })(),
      }}
    >
      <JsonTreeView.Tree className={styles.Tree} arrow={<ChevronRightIcon />} />
    </JsonTreeView.Root>
  )
}

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { JsonTreeView } from '@ark-ui/solid/json-tree-view'
import { ChevronRightIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import styles from 'styles/json-tree-view.module.css'

const testArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Object.defineProperties(testArray, {
  customProperty: { value: 'custom value', enumerable: false, writable: false },
  anotherProperty: { value: 42, enumerable: false, writable: false },
})

export const ArrayData = () => {
  return (
    <JsonTreeView.Root
      defaultExpandedDepth={1}
      class={styles.Root}
      data={{
        normalArray: [1, 2, 3],
        arrayWithNonEnumerableProperties: testArray,
        sparseArray: (() => {
          const sparse = []
          sparse[0] = 'first'
          sparse[5] = 'sixth'
          return sparse
        })(),
      }}

>
  <JsonTreeView.Tree class={styles.Tree}>
    {#snippet arrow()}
      <ChevronRightIcon />
    {/snippet}
  </JsonTreeView.Tree>
</JsonTreeView.Root>

```

const data = [
  function sum(a: number, b: number) {
    return a + b
  },
  async (promises: Promise<any>[]) => await Promise.all(promises),
  function* generator(a: number) {
    while (a > 0) {
      yield a - 1
    }
  },
]

export const Functions = () => {
  return (
    <JsonTreeView.Root defaultExpandedDepth={1} className={styles.Root} data={data}>
      <JsonTreeView.Tree className={styles.Tree} arrow={<ChevronRightIcon />} />
    </JsonTreeView.Root>
  )
}

```

#### Solid

### Controlling Expand Level

Use the `defaultExpandedDepth` prop to control how many levels are expanded by default:

**Example: expand-level**

#### React

```tsx
import { JsonTreeView } from '@ark-ui/react/json-tree-view'
import { ChevronRightIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import styles from 'styles/json-tree-view.module.css'

export const ExpandLevel = () => {
  return (
    <JsonTreeView.Root
      className={styles.Root}
      defaultExpandedDepth={2}
      data={{
        name: 'John Doe',
        age: 30,
        email: 'john.doe@example.com',
        tags: ['tag1', 'tag2', 'tag3'],
        address: {
          street: '123 Main St',
          city: 'Anytown',
          state: 'CA',
          zip: '12345',
        },
      }}
    >
      <JsonTreeView.Tree className={styles.Tree} arrow={<ChevronRightIcon />} />
    </JsonTreeView.Root>
  )
}

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { JsonTreeView } from '@ark-ui/solid/json-tree-view'
import { ChevronRightIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import styles from 'styles/json-tree-view.module.css'

export const ExpandLevel = () => {
  return (
    <JsonTreeView.Root
      class={styles.Root}
      defaultExpandedDepth={2}
      data={{
        name: 'John Doe',
        age: 30,
        email: 'john.doe@example.com',
        tags: ['tag1', 'tag2', 'tag3'],
        address: {
          street: '123 Main St',
          city: 'Anytown',
          state: 'CA',
          zip: '12345',
        },
      }}
    >
      <JsonTreeView.Tree class={styles.Tree} arrow={<ChevronRightIcon />} />
    </JsonTreeView.Root>
  )
}

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { JsonTreeView } from '@ark-ui/vue/json-tree-view'
import { ChevronRightIcon } from 'lucide-vue-next'
import styles from 'styles/json-tree-view.module.css'

const data = {
  name: 'John Doe',
  age: 30,
  email: 'john.doe@example.com',
  tags: ['tag1', 'tag2', 'tag3'],
  address: {
    street: '123 Main St',
    city: 'Anytown',
    state: 'CA',
    zip: '12345',
  },
}
</script>

<template>
  <JsonTreeView.Root :class="styles.Root" :defaultExpandedDepth="2" :data="data">
    <JsonTreeView.Tree :class="styles.Tree">
      <template #arrow>
        <ChevronRightIcon />
      </template>
    </JsonTreeView.Tree>
  </JsonTreeView.Root>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { JsonTreeView } from '@ark-ui/svelte/json-tree-view'
  import { ChevronRightIcon } from 'lucide-svelte'
  import styles from 'styles/json-tree-view.module.css'
</script>

<JsonTreeView.Root
  class={styles.Root}
  defaultExpandedDepth={2}
  data={{

  }}
>
  <JsonTreeView.Tree class={styles.Tree}>
    {#snippet arrow()}
      <ChevronRightIcon />
    {/snippet}
  </JsonTreeView.Tree>
</JsonTreeView.Root>

```

### Custom Value Rendering

You can customize how specific values are rendered using the `renderValue` prop. This example shows how to make email
addresses clickable:

**Example: render-value**

#### React

```tsx
import { JsonTreeView } from '@ark-ui/react/json-tree-view'
import { ChevronRightIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import styles from 'styles/json-tree-view.module.css'

export const RenderValue = () => {
  return (
    <JsonTreeView.Root
      className={styles.Root}
      defaultExpandedDepth={2}
      data={{
        name: 'John Doe',
        age: 30,
        number: Number.NaN,
        email: 'john.doe@example.com',

```

### Configuration Options

The JSON tree view supports several configuration options to customize the display:

```tsx
<JsonTreeView.Root
  data={data}
  defaultExpandedDepth={2}
  quotesOnKeys={true}
  showNonenumerable={true}
  maxPreviewItems={5}
  collapseStringsAfterLength={50}
  groupArraysAfterLength={100}
>
  <JsonTreeView.Tree arrow={<ChevronRightIcon />} />
</JsonTreeView.Root>
```

**Configuration Options:**

- **`quotesOnKeys`**: Whether to show quotes around object keys
- **`showNonenumerable`**: Whether to show non-enumerable properties
- **`maxPreviewItems`**: Maximum number of items to show in object/array previews
- **`collapseStringsAfterLength`**: Collapse strings longer than this length
- **`groupArraysAfterLength`**: Group array items when array is longer than this length

### Using the Root Provider

The `RootProvider` component provides a context for the JSON tree view. It accepts the value of the `useJsonTreeView`
hook. You can leverage it to access the component state and methods from outside the JSON tree view.

**Example: root-provider**

#### React

```tsx
import { JsonTreeView, useJsonTreeView } from '@ark-ui/react/json-tree-view'
import { ChevronRightIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import styles from 'styles/json-tree-view.module.css'

export const RootProvider = () => {
  const jsonTreeView = useJsonTreeView({
    defaultExpandedDepth: 1,
    data: {
      name: 'John Doe',
      age: 30,
      email: 'john.doe@example.com',
      tags: ['tag1', 'tag2', 'tag3'],
      address: {
        street: '123 Main St',
        city: 'Anytown',
        state: 'CA',
        zip: '12345',
      },
    },
  })

  return (
    <JsonTreeView.RootProvider className={styles.Root} value={jsonTreeView}>
      <JsonTreeView.Tree className={styles.Tree} arrow={<ChevronRightIcon />} />
    </JsonTreeView.RootProvider>
  )
}

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { JsonTreeView, useJsonTreeView } from '@ark-ui/solid/json-tree-view'

    },
  })

  return (
    <JsonTreeView.RootProvider class={styles.Root} value={jsonTreeView}>
      <JsonTreeView.Tree class={styles.Tree} arrow={<ChevronRightIcon />} />
    </JsonTreeView.RootProvider>
  )

  <JsonTreeView.Tree class={styles.Tree}>
    {#snippet arrow()}
      <ChevronRightIcon />

</JsonTreeView.RootProvider>

```

> If you're using the `RootProvider` component, you don't need to use the `Root` component.

## Accessibility

The JSON tree view is built on top of the Tree View component and complies with the
[Tree View WAI-ARIA design pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/treeview/).

### Keyboard Support

**`Tab`**
Description: Moves focus to the tree view, placing the first tree view item in focus.

**`Enter + Space`**
Description: Selects the item or branch node

**`ArrowDown`**
Description: Moves focus to the next node

**`ArrowUp`**
Description: Moves focus to the previous node

**`ArrowRight`**
Description: When focus is on a closed branch node, opens the branch.<br> When focus is on an open branch node, moves focus to the first item node.

**`ArrowLeft`**
Description: When focus is on an open branch node, closes the node.<br> When focus is on an item or branch node, moves focus to its parent branch node.

**`Home`**
Description: Moves focus to first node without opening or closing a node.

**`End`**
Description: Moves focus to the last node that can be focused without expanding any nodes that are closed.

**`a-z + A-Z`**
Description: Focus moves to the next node with a name that starts with the typed character. The search logic ignores nodes that are descendants of closed branch.

**`*`**
Description: Expands all sibling nodes that are at the same depth as the focused node.

**`Shift + ArrowDown`**
Description: Moves focus to and toggles the selection state of the next node.

**`Shift + ArrowUp`**
Description: Moves focus to and toggles the selection state of the previous node.

**`Ctrl + A`**
Description: Selects all nodes in the tree. If all nodes are selected, unselects all nodes.


# Locale

## Setup

The `LocaleProvider` component sets the locale for your app, formatting dates, numbers, and other locale-specific data.

> **Note:** If no `LocaleProvider` is setup, the default locale for the app will be `en-US` and therefore the direction
> will be `ltr`.

<ExampleCode id="setup" component="locale" />

## Usage

To access the current locale and direction settings, use the `useLocaleContext` hook.

<ExampleCode id="usage" component="locale" />

# Presence

## Examples

By default the child component starts out as hidden and remains hidden after the `present` state is toggled off. This is
useful for situations where the element needs to be hidden initially and continue to stay hidden after its presence is
no longer required.

**Example: basic**

#### React

```tsx
import { Presence } from '@ark-ui/react/presence'
import { useState } from 'react'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/presence.module.css'

export const Basic = () => {
  const [present, setPresent] = useState(false)
  return (
    <div className="stack">
      <button className={button.Root} type="button" onClick={() => setPresent(!present)}>
        Toggle
      </button>
      <Presence className={styles.Box} present={present}>
        Content
      </Presence>
    </div>
  )
}

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Presence } from '@ark-ui/solid/presence'
import { createSignal } from 'solid-js'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/presence.module.css'

export const Basic = () => {
  const [present, setPresent] = createSignal(false)
  return (
    <div class="stack">
      <button class={button.Root} type="button" onClick={() => setPresent(!present())}>
        Toggle
      </button>
      <Presence class={styles.Box} present={present()}>
        Content
      </Presence>
    </div>
  )
}

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Presence } from '@ark-ui/vue/presence'
import { ref } from 'vue'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/presence.module.css'

const isPresent = ref(false)
</script>

<template>
  <div class="stack">
    <button :class="button.Root" @click="isPresent = !isPresent">Toggle</button>
    <Presence :class="styles.Box" :present="isPresent">Content</Presence>
  </div>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Presence, type PresenceProps } from '@ark-ui/svelte/presence'
  import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
  import styles from 'styles/presence.module.css'

  const props: PresenceProps = $props()
  let present = $state(false)

  function toggle() {
    present = !present
  }
</script>

<div class="stack">
  <button class={button.Root} onclick={toggle}>Toggle</button>
  <Presence {...props} class={styles.Box} {present}>Content</Presence>
</div>

```

### Lazy Mount

To delay the mounting of a child component until the `present` prop is set to true, use the `lazyMount` prop:

**Example: lazy-mount**

#### React

```tsx
import { Presence } from '@ark-ui/react/presence'
import { useState } from 'react'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/presence.module.css'

export const LazyMount = () => {
  const [present, setPresent] = useState(false)
  return (
    <div className="stack">
      <button className={button.Root} type="button" onClick={() => setPresent(!present)}>
        Toggle
      </button>
      <Presence className={styles.Box} present={present} lazyMount>
        Lazy Mounted
      </Presence>
    </div>
  )
}

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Presence } from '@ark-ui/solid/presence'
import { createSignal } from 'solid-js'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/presence.module.css'

export const LazyMount = () => {
  const [present, setPresent] = createSignal(false)
  return (
    <div class="stack">
      <button class={button.Root} type="button" onClick={() => setPresent(!present())}>
        Toggle
      </button>
      <Presence class={styles.Box} present={present()} lazyMount>
        Lazy Mounted
      </Presence>
    </div>
  )
}

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Presence } from '@ark-ui/vue/presence'
import { ref } from 'vue'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/presence.module.css'

const isPresent = ref(false)
</script>

<template>
  <div class="stack">
    <button :class="button.Root" @click="isPresent = !isPresent">Toggle</button>
    <Presence :class="styles.Box" :present="isPresent" lazyMount>Lazy Mounted</Presence>
  </div>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Presence, type PresenceProps } from '@ark-ui/svelte/presence'
  import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
  import styles from 'styles/presence.module.css'

  const props: PresenceProps = $props()
  let present = $state(false)

  function toggle() {
    present = !present
  }
</script>

<div class="stack">
  <button class={button.Root} onclick={toggle}>Toggle</button>
  <Presence {...props} class={styles.Box} lazyMount {present}>Lazy Mounted</Presence>
</div>

```

### Unmount on Exit

To remove the child component from the DOM when it's not present, use the `unmountOnExit` prop:

**Example: unmount-on-exit**

#### React

```tsx
import { Presence } from '@ark-ui/react/presence'
import { useState } from 'react'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/presence.module.css'

export const UnmountOnExit = () => {
  const [present, setPresent] = useState(false)
  return (
    <div className="stack">
      <button className={button.Root} type="button" onClick={() => setPresent(!present)}>
        Toggle
      </button>
      <Presence className={styles.Box} present={present} unmountOnExit>
        Unmount on Exit
      </Presence>
    </div>
  )
}

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Presence } from '@ark-ui/solid/presence'
import { createSignal } from 'solid-js'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/presence.module.css'

export const UnmountOnExit = () => {
  const [present, setPresent] = createSignal(false)
  return (
    <div class="stack">
      <button class={button.Root} type="button" onClick={() => setPresent(!present())}>
        Toggle
      </button>
      <Presence class={styles.Box} present={present()} unmountOnExit>
        Unmount on Exit
      </Presence>
    </div>
  )
}

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Presence } from '@ark-ui/vue/presence'
import { ref } from 'vue'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/presence.module.css'

const isPresent = ref(false)
</script>

<template>
  <div class="stack">
    <button :class="button.Root" @click="isPresent = !isPresent">Toggle</button>
    <Presence :class="styles.Box" :present="isPresent" unmountOnExit>Unmount on Exit</Presence>
  </div>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Presence, type PresenceProps } from '@ark-ui/svelte/presence'
  import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
  import styles from 'styles/presence.module.css'

  const props: PresenceProps = $props()
  let present = $state(false)

  function toggle() {
    present = !present
  }
</script>

<div class="stack">
  <button class={button.Root} onclick={toggle}>Toggle</button>
  <Presence {...props} class={styles.Box} unmountOnExit {present}>Unmount on Exit</Presence>
</div>

```

### Combining Lazy Mount and Unmount on Exit

Both `lazyMount` and `unmountOnExit` can be combined for a component to be mounted only when it's present and to be
unmounted when it's no longer present:

**Example: lazy-mount-and-unmount-on-exit**

#### React

```tsx
import { Presence } from '@ark-ui/react/presence'
import { useState } from 'react'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/presence.module.css'

export const LazyMountAndUnmountOnExit = () => {
  const [present, setPresent] = useState(false)
  return (
    <div className="stack">
      <button className={button.Root} type="button" onClick={() => setPresent(!present)}>
        Toggle
      </button>
      <Presence className={styles.Box} present={present} lazyMount unmountOnExit>
        Lazy + Unmount
      </Presence>
    </div>
  )
}

```

#### Solid

```tsx
import { Presence } from '@ark-ui/solid/presence'
import { createSignal } from 'solid-js'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/presence.module.css'

export const LazyMountAndUnmountOnExit = () => {
  const [present, setPresent] = createSignal(false)
  return (
    <div class="stack">
      <button class={button.Root} type="button" onClick={() => setPresent(!present())}>
        Toggle
      </button>
      <Presence class={styles.Box} present={present()} lazyMount unmountOnExit>
        Lazy + Unmount
      </Presence>
    </div>
  )
}

```

#### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Presence } from '@ark-ui/vue/presence'
import { ref } from 'vue'
import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
import styles from 'styles/presence.module.css'

const isPresent = ref(false)
</script>

<template>
  <div class="stack">
    <button :class="button.Root" @click="isPresent = !isPresent">Toggle</button>
    <Presence :class="styles.Box" :present="isPresent" lazyMount unmountOnExit>Lazy + Unmount</Presence>
  </div>
</template>

```

#### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Presence, type PresenceProps } from '@ark-ui/svelte/presence'
  import button from 'styles/button.module.css'
  import styles from 'styles/presence.module.css'

  const props: PresenceProps = $props()
  let present = $state(false)

  function toggle() {
    present = !present
  }
</script>

<div class="stack">
  <button class={button.Root} onclick={toggle}>Toggle</button>
  <Presence {...props} class={styles.Box} lazyMount unmountOnExit {present}>Lazy + Unmount</Presence>
</div>

```
